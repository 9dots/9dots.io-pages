## Setup
### Each Group Needs

- 20 pieces of uncooked sp## Setup

### Each Group Needs
- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 30 small marshmallows

## Engage

- What are the tallest buildings you can think of?

- How do those buildings stay up?

Engineers know what materials and shapes are the most stable and use those to design strong structures.  

Engineers often have a budget and cannot always use all of the resources they would like. Today, students are limited to building their structure with only spaghetti and marshmallows.

## Explore

Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build the tallest tower that they can. At the end of this session, the students take measurements of their towers using a ruler.

## Explain

Students should try building different types (squares, triangles, etcâ€¦) of geometric shapes using the spaghetti and marshmallows. They will then try applying force to each shape. 

After testing them, discuss with the students:

- Which geometric shapes seemed the strongest?

```
Building with equilateral triangles creates the strongest structures because any weight put on the triangle is evenly distributed among the sides.
```

Explain that this strength is called structural rigidity and it means that the structure does not change shape when a force is applied to it.

- Which three dimensional shape is made up of triangles and would be a good choice for building?

```
Triangular Pyramids because they are made up of 4 equilateral triangles.
```

Show students how to reinforce a square by adding diagonal braces. Have them practice using their spaghetti and marshmallows.

By adding a spaghetti that goes diagonally across the square, you can turn the square into 2 triangles. If you add one more spaghetti along the other diagonal, you can break your square into 4 triangles, making it very sturdy.

Show students pictures of various structures (the [Eiffel Tower](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GXrvCUupVmE/UcRidMzqxyI/AAAAAAAAnVQ/UbL-ZaCSPx0/s1600/eiffel+tower+metal+frame+close+up+7.jpg), [Epcot Center](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Spaceship_Earth_2.jpg), [Bridge 1](http://ns1758.ca/rail/dar-bridge-23712tc-2011dec13.jpg), [Bridge 2](http://passyworldofmathematics.com/Images/pwmImagesFour/BridgeTrianglesOne550x281JPG.jpg)) and all of the triangles that are used in their structures.

## Elaborate

Students will throw out their first attempts and begin a second round of building with fresh spaghetti and marshmallows

## Evaluate

Each group will give a short presentation about their tower. 

- How tall was your structure? 
- What shape did your group use? 
- What would you do differently if you could try to build the tower again?

## Standards

Standard | Description | Connection
--- | --- | ---
3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. | Engage
3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Explain
MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Evaluate
