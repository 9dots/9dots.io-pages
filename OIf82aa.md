objective: "By the end of the project, students will be able to identify the best shapes for building a tower."

## Setup
### Each Group Needs

- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 30 small marshmallows

## Introduce
- What are the tallest buildings you can think of?

- How do those buildings stay up?

Engineers know what materials and shapes are the most stable and use those to design strong structures.  

Engineers often have a budget and cannot always use all of the resources they would like. Today, students are limited to building their structure with only spaghetti and marshmallows.

## Explore
Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build the tallest tower that they can. At the end of this session, the students will use their rulers to measure their tower.

## Inquire
Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room. Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss:

- Which geometric shapes seemed the strongest?

Building with equilateral triangles creates the strongest structures because any weight put on the triangle is evenly distributed among the sides.

- Which three dimensional shape is made up of triangles and would be a good choice for building?

Triangular Pyramids because they are made up of 4 equilateral triangles.
 
- How can you strengthen a square?

By adding a spaghetti that goes diagonally across the square, you can turn the square into 2 triangles. If you add one more spaghetti along the other diagonal, you can break your square into 4 triangles, making it very sturdy.

## Innovate
With their new information the students will try again to build the tallest possible tower.

## Discuss
Each group will give a short presentation about their tower. 

- How tall was your structure? 
- What shape did your group use? 
- What would you do differently if you could try to build the tower again?
