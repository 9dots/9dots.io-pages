## Lesson Overview
This exploration driven lesson teaches students about strucural rigidity. Students explore by building a tower out of spaghetti and marshmallows without any background. After a quick build, students will learn about structural rigidity in a hands on demonstration. Students demonstrate learning by creating a taller tower in the second round using optimal building shapes.

## Setup

### Materials:

#### Each group needs:

- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 30 small marshmallows

### Preparations:

- Set up bag with supplies for each group

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Discuss tall building and engineering with students to get them thinking about building towers.

1. Ask some questions to get students thinking about structural rigidity.
	1. What are the tallest buildings you can think of?
	2. How do those buildings stay up?

2. Engineers know what materials and shapes are the most stable and use those to design strong structures.  

3. Engineers often have a budget and cannot always use all of the resources they would like. Today, students are limited to building their structure with only spaghetti and marshmallows.

## Explore - 10 minutes
The first round of building spaghetti marshmallow towers. Students build without any explanation of the better building shapes.

1. Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build the tallest tower that they can. 

2. At the end of this session, the students take measurements of their towers using a ruler.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Teach students about structural rigidity through a hands on demonstration with different shapes.

1. Students try building different types (squares, triangles, etcâ€¦) of geometric shapes using the spaghetti and marshmallows. 

2. Students try applying force to each shape (push on one side or from a corner). 

3. After testing them, discuss with the students, _"Which geometric shapes seemed the strongest?"_
	- Building with equilateral triangles creates the strongest structures because any weight put on the triangle is evenly distributed among the sides.

4. Explain that this strength is called **structural rigidity** and it means that the structure does not change shape when a force is applied to it.

5. Ask students, _"Which three dimensional shape is made up of triangles and would be a good choice for building?'_
	- Triangular Pyramids because they are made up of 4 equilateral triangles.

6. Show students how to reinforce a square by adding diagonal braces. Have them practice using their spaghetti and marshmallows.

7. By adding a spaghetti that goes diagonally across the square, you can turn the square into 2 triangles. If you add one more spaghetti along the other diagonal, you can break your square into 4 triangles, making it very sturdy.

8. Show students pictures of various structures (the [Eiffel Tower](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GXrvCUupVmE/UcRidMzqxyI/AAAAAAAAnVQ/UbL-ZaCSPx0/s1600/eiffel+tower+metal+frame+close+up+7.jpg), [Epcot Center](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Spaceship_Earth_2.jpg), [Bridge 1](http://ns1758.ca/rail/dar-bridge-23712tc-2011dec13.jpg), [Bridge 2](http://passyworldofmathematics.com/Images/pwmImagesFour/BridgeTrianglesOne550x281JPG.jpg)) and all of the triangles that are used in their structures.

## Elaborate - 15 minutes

Students throw out their first attempts and begin a second round of building with fresh spaghetti and marshmallows.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

Each group will give a short presentation about their tower. 

- How tall was your structure? 
- What shape did your group use? 
- What would you do differently if you could try to build the tower again?
