## Setup

### Materials (per group): 

- 1 yard of string
- 1 yard of tape
- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 1 large marshmallow

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

Start by asking a series of questions:

- What is an innovator? 
	- An innovator is someone who strives to better their local and global communities through creative problem solving.
- Who are some famous innovators that you know of?
	- Recognizable innovators include Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Elon Musk (founder of Paypal, Tesla, and SpaceX), Steve Jobs (Apple), and Margaret Chan (Director General of World Health Organization).
- What are some important attributes to become an innovator?  
	- Some important attributes are determination, creativity, and the ability to collaborate.

## Explore - 15 minutes

1. Distribute one bag of supplies to each team.  

2. Each team now has ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build the tallest possible tower that can support a marshmallow. 

3. At the end of this session, the students use their rulers to measure their tower.

## Explain - 10 minutes

1. Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  Afterwards everyone sits down and discusses what strategies worked the best. 

2. Discuss what creative solutions people had used in their projects. 

- What could they do differently to go even taller?
- What is a counterbalance?

3. A counterbalance is a weight that balances another weight.  Students can counterbalance an existing force by applying an opposite force. 

	- What is tension?
		- Tension is the pulling force created by a string or cable on another object.

	- How can students create tension in the string?
		- Tension in the string could be created by attaching one side of the string to the tower and the other to a stationary object like the desk or table.

	- How can students use that tension to counterbalance gravity?

		- By leaning the tower in the opposite direction that the string is pulling, an effective counterbalance can be created.

4. One possibility is for the string to be used to counterbalance a leaning spaghetti tower.![](http://uploads.9dots.io/OJEPMO1.png) 

## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Distribute new materials to each group. Students have 10 minutes to use their new information to build a taller tower.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Ask students which team they though was the most creative with their design. 

- How did your own team work together to combine several creative ideas? 

- If they could build another tower what could you do differently to build it taller?

- If you could have one more building material, what would it be and why?
