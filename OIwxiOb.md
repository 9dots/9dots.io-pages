title: Spaghetti String Tower
blurb: "Students will need to get creative to build towers capable of supporting a marshmallow with only string, tape, and uncooked spaghetti."
org: 9dots
objective: "By the end of the lesson, students will be able to produce a freestanding structure with the limited materials supplied to them."

## Setup
#### Each group will recieve a paper bag containing: 

- 1 yard of string
- 1 yard of tape
- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 1 large marshmallow

## Introduce
Start by asking a series of questions:

- What is an innovator? 

An innovator is someone who strives to better their local and global communities through creative problem solving.

- Who are some famous innovators that you know of?

Recognizable innovators include Elon Musk (founder of Paypal, Tesla, and SpaceX), Steve Jobs (Apple), and Margaret Chan (Director General of World Health Orginization).

- What are some important attributes to become an innovator?  

Some important attributes are grit, creativity, and the ability to collaborate.

Tell students that today they will have to build a tower out of the surprise materials that they find in the bags. The goal is to build the tallest possible tower that can support a marshmallow. They are encouraged to be creative in their designs.

## Explore
Distribute one bag of supplies to each team.  Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to complete their goal. At the end of this session, the students will use their rulers to measure their tower.

## Inquire
Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss what strategies worked the best. Discuss what creative solutions people had used in their projects. 

- What could they do differently to go even taller?
- How could the string be used to support the tower?

One possibility is for the string to be used to counterbalance a leaning spaghetti tower.![](http://uploads.9dots.io/OJEPMO1.png) 

## Innovate
Distribute new materials to each group and then tell students that they have 20 minutes to try to achieve their goal.

## Discuss
Ask students which team they though was the most creative with their design. 

- How did your own team work together to combine several creative ideas? 
- If they could build another tower what could you do differently to build it taller?
- If you could have one more building material, what would it be and why?
