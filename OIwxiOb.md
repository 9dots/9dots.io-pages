## Setup
#### Each group will need: 
- 1 yard of string
- 1 yard of tape
- 20 pieces of uncooked spaghetti
- 1 large marshmallow

## Introduce
Ask the students what an innovator is. Who are some famous innovators that they know of? What are some important attributes to become an innovator?  Tell students that today they will have to build a tower out of the surprise materials that they find in the bags. The goal is to build the tallest possible tower that can support a marshmallow. They are encouraged to be creative in their designs.

## Explore
Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to complete their goal. At the end of this session, the students will use their rulers to measure their tower.

## Inquire
Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss what strategies worked the best. Discuss what creative solutions people had used in their projects
	- What could they do differently to go even taller?
	- How could the string be used to support the tower?

## Innovate
With their new information the students will build the tallest possible tower.

## Discuss
Ask students which team they though was the most creative with their design. 
	- How did your own team work together to combine several creative ideas? 
    - If they could build another tower what could you do differently to build it taller?
    - If you could have one more building material, what would it be and why?
