## Setup
#### Each group will need: 
- 4 Straws
- 4 Mint lifesavers
- 2 Index cards
- 1 Paper lunch sack
- Masking tape

## Introduce
Discuss with students what they think “energy” is.  Energy is the ability to do work. Distribute information on different types of fuels to the students.  Review information about gasoline, ethanol, compressed natural gas, electricity, and biodiesel.  Kid-friendly information can be found online here.  After students have reviewed their information, have them present to the class information about the fuel including:
- Where does it come from?
- Is it renewable?
- Fun fact.

## Explore
Tell the students that the goal of the project is to build a vehicle that moves the furthest with 3 blows.  They have 10 minutes to attempt to build one right away.

## Inquire
Ask the students what is working well. 
	- What needs to be improved upon? 
    - What other types of vehicles use the wind to move?
    - What makes them move fast? 
	- What works better: a big sail or a small sail?

## Innovate
With their new knowledge it is time to start fresh and build a new puff mobile. When they are finished, each team will test their puff mobile by blowing three times at their vehicle. The winner will be whichever puff mobile makes it the furthest. Alternately, you can also have the students race their puff mobiles across a set distance.

## Discuss
- What is energy?
- What are three type of fuel sources?
- Are the puff-mobiles fuel renewable?
- Why did the winning car win?
