## Setup
#### Each group will need: 
- 4 Straws
- 4 Mint lifesavers
- 2 Index cards
- 1 Paper lunch sack
- Masking tape

## Introduce
Discuss with students what they think “energy” is.  Energy is the ability to do work. Distribute information on different types of fuels to the students.  Review information about gasoline, ethanol, compressed natural gas, electricity, and biodiesel.  Kid-friendly information can be found online [here](http://www.eia.gov/kids/).  After students have reviewed their information, have them present to the class information about the fuel including:

- Where does it come from?
- Is it renewable?
- Fun fact.

## Explore
Tell the students that the goal of the project is to build a vehicle that moves the furthest using only the wind generated by exhaling three times.  They have 10 minutes to attempt to build one right away.

## Inquire
Ask the students: 

- What is working well?
- What needs to be improved upon? 
- What other types of vehicles use the wind to move?

Sail boats, wind surfers, kites, etc...

- What makes them move fast? 

"Catching" more of the wind from each breath makes the vehicles move faster.

- What works better: a big sail or a small sail?

In general, a big sail will catch more wind and therefore provide more energy than a smaller sail.

## Innovate
Distribute fresh materials to each team and give them 20 minutes to attempt to complete their vehicle. When they are finished, each team will test their puff mobile by blowing three times at their vehicle. The winner will be whichever puff mobile makes it the furthest. Alternately, you can also have the students race their puff mobiles across a set distance.

## Discuss
Discuss with the students: 

- What is energy?
- What are three type of fuel sources?
- Are the puff-mobiles fuel renewable?
- What made the winning vehicle the most efficient?
