blurb: "This exploration driven lesson starts with a short research project about alternative fuels. Students learn about a specific alternative fuel and present findings to the class. Then, students create puff mobiles which are small wind powered vehicles. The puff mobiles will be tested to see which can travel the furthest with three breaths of air."

## Setup
### Materials:

#### Each group will need:

- 4 Straws
- 4 Mint lifesavers
- 2 Index cards
- 1 Paper lunch sack
- Masking tape

### Preparations:

- Set up paper bags with materials inside for each group
- Print out energy information from http://www.eia.gov/kids/

### Project Time:

- 50 minutes

## Engage - 10 minutes
Get students thinking about energy and alternative fuel by doing a short research project with information provided to them.

1. Discuss with students what they think “energy” is. 
	- Energy is the ability to do work. 

2. Distribute information on different types of fuels to the students.  
	- Review information about gasoline, ethanol, compressed natural gas, electricity, and biodiesel.  
    - Kid-friendly information can be found online [here](http://www.eia.gov/kids/).  
    
3. Break students into groups of 2-4 and have them research a specific type of fuel.

4. Each group presents to the class information about the fuel including:
  - Where does it come from?
  - Is it renewable?
  - A fun fact.
  
## Explore - 10 minutes
Student have ten minutes to build a wind powered car with the supplies in their paper bags.

1. Break students into groups of two and distribute a bag of supplies to each group.

2. Tell the students that the goal of the project is to build a vehicle that moves the furthest using only the wind generated by exhaling three times.  

3. They have 10 minutes to attempt to build one right away.

4. Each group tests their car by blowing on it three times and measuring how far it goes.

## Explain - 5 minutes
Teach students about how to build a better car by relating it to other similar wind powered vehicles.

1. Ask the students: 
  - What is working well?
  - What needs to be improved upon? 

2. What other types of vehicles use the wind to move?
	- Sail boats, wind surfers, kites, etc...

3. What makes those vehicles move fast? 
	- "Catching" more of the wind from each breath makes the vehicles move faster.

4. What works better: a big sail or a small sail?
	- In general, a big sail will catch more wind and therefore provide more energy than a smaller sail.

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
Gives student another chance at creating a wind powered car. After, students will test their cars against each other to see which can travel the furthest. 

1. Distribute fresh materials to each team and give them 20 minutes to attempt to complete their vehicle. 

2. When they are finished, each team will test their puff mobile by blowing three times at their vehicle. 

3. The winner will be whichever puff mobile makes it the furthest. Alternately, you can also have the students race their puff mobiles across a set distance.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

- What is energy?

- What are three type of fuel sources?

- Are the puff-mobiles fuel renewable?

- What made the winning vehicle the most efficient?
