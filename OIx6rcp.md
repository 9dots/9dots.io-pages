## Setup
#### Each group will need: 
- Printer paper (5 pieces per team)
- Tape (masking or scotch)
- 1 paper plate
- Large weight (we used mini pumpkins)

## Introduce
Begin by reviewing with students what they know about gravity.  
- Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.
- Discuss with students how buildings work.  Particularly, ask them why, if you are standing on the second floor of a building with a room underneath you, does the floor not collapse?  Lead them to the point that the structural walls are bearing most of the weight.
Challenge students to use 5 pieces of printer paper to hold as many pumpkins ~11 inches in the air.  As students finish, challenge them to try the structure ~22 inches high, and ~33  inches high.

## Explore
Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build a tower that is 11 inches tall that can hold as much weight as possible.

## Inquire
Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss what strategies worked the best. Discuss what creative solutions people had used in their projects.  What could they do differently to go even taller?

## Innovate
With their new information the students will try to build a tower that is ~ 22 inches tall and capable of holding the weights.  If they are succesful at this they can try to build a tower that is ~ 33 inches tall.

## Discuss
