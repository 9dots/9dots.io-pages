objective: "By the end of the lesson, students will be able to define a structural wall and demonstrate learning by creating a sturdy tower capable of holding weight."

## Setup
#### Each group will need: 

- Printer paper (5 pieces per team)
- Tape (masking or scotch)
- 1 paper plate
- Large weight (we used mini pumpkins)

## Introduce
Begin by reviewing with students what they know about gravity. 

- Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.
- Discuss with students how buildings work.  Particularly, ask them why, if you are standing on the second floor of a building with a room underneath you, does the floor not collapse?  Lead them to the point that the structural walls are bearing most of the weight.
- Challenge students to use 5 pieces of printer paper to hold as many pumpkins ~11 inches in the air.

## Explore
Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build a tower that is 11 inches tall that can hold as much weight as possible.

## Inquire
Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss what strategies worked the best. 

- Which designs had the best structural walls?
- What could they do differently that would help them make their buildings taller?

## Innovate
With their new information the students will try to build a tower that is ~ 22 inches tall and capable of holding the weights.  If they are succesful at this they can try to build a tower that is ~ 33 inches tall.

## Discuss
- What is tension? Demonstrate with your hands.
- What is compression? Demonstrate with your hands.
- What is a structural wall?
