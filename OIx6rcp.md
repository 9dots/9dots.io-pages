## Lesson Overview
This engineering challenge teaches students about tension and compression as well as the importance of structural walls for building. Students demonstrate learning by completing a challenge to build the tallest tower that can hold all of the supplied weights.

## Setup

### Each group will need: 

- Printer paper (5 pieces per team)
- Tape (masking or scotch)
- 1 paper plate
- Large weight (we used mini pumpkins)

### Preparation:

- Distribute supplies to each group

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

Begin by reviewing with students what they know about gravity. 
	
- Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.
- Challenge students to use 5 pieces of printer paper to hold as many pumpkins ~11 inches in the air.

## Explore - 10 minutes
Students now have ten minutes to experiment and attempt to build a tower that is 11 inches tall that can hold as much weight as possible.

## Explain - 10 minutes

1. Students have five minutes to look at the other towers in the room.  

2. Afterwards everyone will sit down and discuss what strategies worked the best. 
	- Which designs had the best structural walls?
	- What could they do differently that would help them make their buildings taller?

3. 	Discuss with students how buildings work.  Particularly, ask them "If you are standing on the second floor of a building with a room underneath you, does the floor not collapse?"  
	- Lead them to the point that the structural walls are bearing most of the weight.
    
4. Introduce the concepts of tension and compression.  
	- Have students clasp their hands and pull outwards.  This is tension.  
    - Now have students clasp their hands and press inwards.  This is compression.  

5. Explain that tension and compression are forces that allow buildings to stand up even under tremendous weights.

## Elaborate - 15 minutes

1. Students build a tower that is ~ 22 inches tall and capable of holding the weights.

2. If they are succesful at this they should try to build a tower that is ~ 33 inches tall.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

Check for understanding by asking some follow up questions.

- What is tension? Demonstrate with your hands.
- What is compression? Demonstrate with your hands.
- What is a structural wall?
