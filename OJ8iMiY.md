## Lesson Overview
Provide an introduction in to robotics and specifically the engineering side of building a robot. To start, students will learn about engineers and watch a brief video about the process of engineering. Students will then build a robot using the instructions provided in the attachments. If there is time at the end, students will attach the touch sensor to their robots.

## Setup

### Materials:
- Lego Mindstorm kit

### Media and Handouts:
- [Introduction to Engineering](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/projectmanagement/videos/engineeringprocess.html) 
- Introduction to parts
- EV3 Educator Model Building Instructions
- NXT REM Building Instructions 

## Engage
Give students an introduction to robotics by explaining the fields associated with it. 

1. Robotics is a field that combines engineering and programming to create machines that are capable of performing tasks autonomously.

1. Discuss with students what they know about being an engineer
	- Engineers use science and math to solve problems and make everyday life easier. 

2. What kind of process do engineers use to solve problems?
	- Show the [introduction to engineering](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/projectmanagement/videos/engineeringprocess.html) video.  

3. Tell students that their goal for this lesson is to build a robot capable of driving in a straight line.

## Explain
Show students the building plans for the EV3 Educator Model. Explain that this robot is helpful for learning how to program the robot, and that students will be coming up with their own designs later in the unit.

## Explore

### BUILD:
Students should now begin building using the plans.  When students are finished, they will run the simple straight line program and see their robot move. Students who finish early can explore further by attaching various sensors to their robot.

## Discuss
_What can servo motors be used for besides moving the robot?_
They are rigid pieces that can help form the frame of your robot.

_Why is it important to clean up Lego pieces properly?_
Future building can be more efficient and more fun if it is not necessary to hunt for every little piece.
