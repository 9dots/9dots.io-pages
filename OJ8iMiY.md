## Setup
#### Materials
Each group will need:
- Lego Mindstorm NXT kit

## Introduce
Ask the students what engineers do and have a discussion. Direct them towards the fact that engineers use science and math to solve problems and make everyday life easier.  Ask what kind of process they think engineers use when they are solving a problem. Show the introduction to [engineering video](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/projectmanagement/videos/engineeringprocess.html "link"). Pass out the document with the sensors and have a discussion about what can be accomplished by using each of the sensors. Tell students that their goal for the afternoon is to build a robot capable of driving in a straight line.  ([Link for straight line program](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxdHB7jON6H0M2NlUlpWVjNIU28/edit))

## Explore
Without doing further research, students will now give their first attempt at building a robot that is capable of driving in a straight line.

## Inquire
If a group has a finished robot you can attempt to run them.  Have a group discussion about what went wrong and what engineers do when their solutions do not work right away.  When the discussions gets to planning and trying again show them the building plans and tell them to choose either design ([REM](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/content/lego/building/build_shows/rem.pdf)  or [TaskBot](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/content/lego/building/build_shows/rem.pdf)). Explain these robots are best for learning and later in the unit they will coming up with their own designs.

## Innovate
Pull apart the attempted robots because it is now time to build using the building plans (REM or TaskBot).  When they are done they will get to run the simple straight line program and see their robot move. If a group finishes early they can attempt to attach various sensors to their robot.

## Discuss
Discuss the importance of the process of engineering, specifically the research, planning, and iterating aspects of the process. Review the Mindstorm NXT sensors and what they can be used for. Finally, discuss the importance of cleaning up the Lego pieces properly so that building can be more efficient and more fun than having to hunt for every little piece.
