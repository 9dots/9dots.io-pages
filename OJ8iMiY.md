blurb: "This lesson provides an introduction to robotics and specifically the engineering side of building a robot. To start, students will learn about engineers and watch a brief video about the process of engineering. Students will then build a robot using the instructions provided in the attachments. If there is time at the end, students will attach the touch sensor to their robots."

**For the nxt robot download the [NXT building plans](http://uploads.9dots.io/OJ8lcC3.pdf)
For the ev3 robot download the [ev3 building plans](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiQX849.pdf)**

## Setup

### Materials:
- Lego Mindstorm kit
- [Introduction to Engineering](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/projectmanagement/videos/engineeringprocess.html) 
- [EV3 Educator Model Building Instructions](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiQX849.pdf)
- [NXT REM Building Instructions](http://uploads.9dots.io/OJ8lcC3.pdf)

### Project Time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage (5 minutes)
Give students an introduction to robotics by explaining the fields associated with it and watching a video about the process of engineering. 

1. Show a video of MIT's [robotic cheetah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMKQbqnXXhQ).

2. Ask students, "What is robotics?"
	- Robotics is a field that combines engineering and programming to create machines that are capable of performing tasks autonomously.

3. Discuss with students what they know about being an engineer
	- Engineers use science and math to solve problems and make everyday life easier. 

2. What kind of process do engineers use to solve problems?
	- After a quick discussion, show the [introduction to engineering](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/projectmanagement/videos/engineeringprocess.html) video.  

3. Tell students that their goal for this lesson is to build a robot capable of driving in a straight line.

## Explain - 5 minutes
Show students the building plans for their robot and explain the importance of building this example robot to help them learn.

1. Show students the building plans for their robot. 

2. Explain that this robot is helpful for learning how to program the robot.

## Explore - 30 minutes

1. Students work on creating their robot according to the plans provided to them. 
	- Students should work in groups of four or less.
2. When they have finished, students use the [straight line program](http://uploads.9dots.io/OJ8kmj2.rbt) to test their robot.
	- For instructions on how to download programs to the robot check out this [wiki](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQoYL1).

## Extension
For students that finish early, explain about the importance of repeatability for robotics.

1. Discuss reasons why the Mindstorm robots can be inconsistent.
	- Battery life can change the angles of turns
    - Gears can slip and cause a slight turn
    - Bumps in the surface of the table can force the robot off course
    
2. Explain things that you can do to account for those inconsistencies.
	- Add pieces to the back of the robot so that when the robot reverses into a barrier, the robot is perpendicular to that wall
    - Use sensors to keep track of where the robot is on the map
    - Start moving at low power so that the wheels do not slip at all

3. Students work on adding legos to their robot to address the issue of aligning their robot perpendicularly to a wall when reversing.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

- What can servo motors be used for besides moving the robot?
	- They are rigid pieces that can help form the frame of your robot.

- What does an engineer do?
	- An engineer uses science and math to solve problem.

- Why is it important to clean up Lego pieces properly?
	- Future building can be more efficient and more fun if it is not necessary to hunt for every little piece.
