title: "Interactive Zine Part 1: Creating your Zine"
blurb: Students will create a 6 page long zine with text and illustrations
org: 9dots
objective: "Students will learn about zines and electricity.  By the end of the lesson, students will be able to express themselves creatively using a zine format, and understand the basics of circuits."

## Setup
Materials for each student:
- Pencil
- Drawing or Construction Paper
- Colored Pencils or Markers
- Scissors
For the speaker circuit, each student will need:
- Copper Foil Tape
- Masking Tape

Handouts and Other Media:
- [Steps on how to fold a 6 page zine](http://www.andrewyang.com/zines/ZineHowTo.pdf)
- [Video on how to fold a zine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHYwtltebR0&feature=youtu.be)

Project Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Introduce
Start with the students in a large group and discuss with students what they think a zine is:  
```
Zine stands for magazine.  Zines are usually published by their author (self-published), and are created to let the author express themself, not to make money.  Unlike with commercial magazines, copies of zines are usually made with photocopiers.
```
What kind of topics can be covered in zines?  

Discuss with students what a circuit is:
```
A circuit is a path that electrons can flow through. Circuits can provide power for electric devices.  Circuits usually have on and off switches.  When the switch is off, electrons can’t pass through.  Circuits need a power source (like batteries) that supplies electrons.
```
## Explore
Show students examples of zines, both paper versions and online.  [This is a list](http://www.zinebook.com/directory/zine-catalogs.html) of places that sell zines online; some cities also have locations that sell and/or loan out zines.  

## Inquire
Inquire:
Show the students the video on how to make a zine-fold book, or follow the drawn instructions below or the instructions with photos [here](http://www.andrewyang.com/zines/ZineHowTo.pdf).  Give students 10-15 minutes to fold their own zine.

## Innovate
Create Story:

1. Assign each student a topic for their zine (or have them pick a topic from a bag).  Students have 20 minutes to write a draft of content for their zine. 

2. At the end of the 20 minutes, students start filling their pages, and add illustrations.  

Please note: Students represent the lines that their circuits will follow with pencil or marker to ensure that the copper foil tape used for the circuits will not cover any important parts of the text.  The lines should be completely connected, except for small gaps at the bottom of the page for the switches.  See the example below:

Wire-Up Story:

3. Students add a circuit to their zines with copper foil tape, by following the pencil lines drawn in Step 1.  The zines are now ready for adding interactivity in the next lesson!

## Discuss
1.  What topics did students choose for their zines?  Give students time to look at and discuss other students’ work.
