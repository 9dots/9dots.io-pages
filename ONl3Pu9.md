title: "Interactive Zine Part 2: Adding Scratch & the Makey Makey"
objective: "Students will learn basic computer programming through Scratch and the Makey Makey.  By the end of the lesson, students will be able to build a simple computer program in Scratch and control it with the MaKey MaKey."
org: 9dots
blurb: Students will learn how to use Scratch and the Makey Makey to add interactivity to their zines.

## Setup
Materials per Student:
- The zine-fold book from the first lesson
- Computer with internet access and sample Scratch program downloaded (see link under Media and Handouts)
- One Makey Makey set

Media and Handouts:
- [Sample Interactive Scratch Program](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/14469579/)  
- [Website](http://nebomusic.net/scratchlesson1/scratchexercise1.html)  with more information on Scratch and an introduction to the layout.

Project time: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Introduce
Start with the students in a large group.  Ask students what a conductor is.  What kind of materials are conductive? 
```
Metals are the most conductive.  Other conductive materials include graphite (pencil lead), tap water, and salt water.  With the MaKey MaKey, students can also use materials that are less conductive such as fruits, gummy candies, and even people.
```
Ask students what they think “interactive mean”?  What are some ways to add interactivity to books?  
- Ask students to brainstorm ways to add sound: for example, adding dialogue, sound effects, the sound of pages turning, etc.
- Ask students to brainstorm ways to add visual effects on the computer

## Explore
Getting familiar with Scratch:
Before plugging in the MaKey MaKey, students play around with Scratch by testing the sample program.

## Inquire
1. Modifying the Scratch program
a. Students make their own Scratch program, using the pre-made program as a guide.    Students should start with the following six code blocks shown below, and snap additional blocks below each code block to add interactivity.

2. Connecting the Makey Makey to the computer and the zine:
a.  Students use the USB cable to connect the Makey Makey Board to their computers.
b.  Students clip the single “ground wire” to the bottom strip of the Makey Makey board labeled “EARTH.” (Green Circle)

c.  Students then clip the other alligator clips from their zines to each section of the Makey Makey board that are the Keyboard Controls set up in their Scratch programs. (Red circle).

3.   Students open their Scratch projects to test their books’ interactions with Scratch.  They use their fingers as the switch to activate each page.

## Discuss
1.  Students should take a few minutes to look at each other's projects.  What kind of programs did students put together?  
2.  What actions happen when the arrow keys or the space button is pressed?  
3.  What kind of materials did students hook up to the Makey Makey?
