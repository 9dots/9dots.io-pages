## Lesson Overview
Students will earn about electricity by building circuits with conductive playdough. Start by introducing students to circuits by playing with an [energy ball](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS). Then, teach students about the different types of circuits. Students demonstrate learning by using the conductive playdough and a power supply to light up LED lights.

## Setup

### Materials for entire class to share:
 - 1 [energy ball](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS) 
 
### Materials per group:

 - The following Squishy Circuit Components, which can be purchased [as kits](http://squishycircuitsstore.com/kits.html) or individually at electronics stores.
 - 1 Motor (optional)  
 - Buzzers (optional)
 - 1 4AA battery pack
 - Different colored LEDs

### Ingredients for the conductive playdough:

 - 1 cup water
 - 1 1/2 cups flour
 - 1/4 cup salt
 - 3 Tbsp. cream of tartar OR 9 Tbsp. lemon juice
 - 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
 - Food coloring (optional)
 - large bowl for mixing ingredients
 - Large spoon to stir ingredients


### Handouts and Other Media:

 - Instructions on making conductive playdough can be found [here](http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/conductiveDough.htm).  9 Dots has found that using warm or hot water works just as well as cooking the dough over the stove, and makes cleanup easier.
 
### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage 

To demonstrate open and closed circuits with the [energy ball](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS):

- Using a pair of students:  Each student touches one of the sensors on the sides of the energy ball, and then hold hands.  What happens?
- With the whole class: Students line up, holding hands, with one student holding the energy ball in one hand.  Students figure out how to arrange themselves so that the ball lights up, showing that the circuit is closed.  When the ball does not light up, the circuit is open.

## Explain

1. Begin by discussing with students what they know about electricity.  Where does it come from? What is it used for?
	- Electricity is a form of energy produced when electrons flow through atoms of matter.  Electricity can come from different sources such as solar power, burning coal, wind turbines, battery power, water power, etc.
    
2. What are electric currents? What kinds of materials carry electric currents?
	- An electric current is the flow of electric charge through some material.  Electricity flows through certain materials called conductors.  All materials are made of tiny atoms.  All atoms have charges on them (either electrons or ions).  In materials that carry electricity, such as metals, the atomâ€™s charges are loosely held onto, and can travel from one atom to another.  This is why wires are made out of metal and not wood.  Other materials that are conductive include salt water and the human body.

3. What is an electric circuit? 
	- In order for the electrical current to flow, it must form a closed path (or loop) where the electrons can connect back to the source of the electric current.  This path is called an electric circuit.
    
4. There are two types of circuits that students are trying to create today: series and parallel.
	- A series circuit is a chain of lights that connect in a loop back to the battery.
    	- In a series the voltage drops to be evenly distributed amongst all of the lights.
        - If one of the lights burns out or is not connected correctly, all of the lights will go out.
    - A parallel circuit has each light connected in parallel to the positive and negative wires (or playdough)
    	- In a parallel circuit, each of the lights gets all of the voltage from the power source.
        - If one of the lights burns out, the rest will still work.

## Elaborate
Students start by exploring with the power source and LED lights. Then students create series and parallel circuits and see how bright the lights are in each set up. 

1. Students figure out how to light a LED with their playdough and their battery.  

2. If students finish this quickly, challenge them to make LEDs light up in parallel and in series.  Give the students time to play around with the concepts of circuits.

```
Please note:  It is best to store the playdough in the refrigerator.  Metal squishy circuit components should be wiped off with a wet paper towel, since the conductive playdough is corrosive and can damage the metal components if not removed.
```

## Evaluate
Check for understanding by asking some questions about circuits.

- How did students light up the LEDs with their Squishy Circuit kits?
- What happens if the circuit is not completed and connected back to the battery?
