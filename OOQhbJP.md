## Setup
Materials for entire class to share:
 - 1 energy ball
Materials per group:
 - The following Squishy Circuit Components, which can be purchased as kits here or individually at electronics stores.
 - 1 Motor (optional)  
 - Buzzers (optional)
 - 1 4AA battery pack
  - different colored LEDs
Ingredients for the conductive playdough:
 - 1 cup water
 - 1 1/2 cups flour
 - 1/4 cup salt
 - 3 Tbsp. cream of tartar OR 9 Tbsp. lemon juice
 - 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
 - Food coloring (optional)
 - large bowl for mixing ingredients
 - Large spoon to stir ingredients

Handouts and Other Media:
 - Instructions on making conductive playdough can be found [here](http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/conductiveDough.htm) .  9 Dots has found that using warm or hot water works just as well as cooking the dough over the stove, and makes cleanup easier.
 
Project Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Introduce
Begin by discussing with students what they know about electricity.  Where does it come from? What do they use it for?
```
Electricity is a form of energy produced when electrons flow through atoms of matter.  Electricity can come from different sources such as solar power, burning coal, wind turbines, battery power, water power, etc.
```
What are electric currents? What kinds of materials carry electric currents? 
```
An electric current is the flow of electric charge through some material.  Electricity flows through certain materials called conductors.   All materials are made of tiny atoms.  All atoms have charges on them (either electrons or ions).  In materials that carry electricity, such as metals, the atomâ€™s charges are loosely held onto, and can travel from one atom to another.  This is why wires are made out of metal and not wood.  Other materials that are conductive include salt water and the human body.
```
What is an electric circuit? 
```
In order for the electrical current to flow, it must form a closed path (or loop) where the electrons can connect back to the source of the electric current.  This path is called an electric circuit.
