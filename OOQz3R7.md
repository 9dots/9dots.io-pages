## Setup
####Materials per group:

 - 1 [Makey Makey kit](http://www.makeymakey.com/) 
 - 1 [Squishy Circuit Kit](http://squishycircuitsstore.com/kits.html) (see previous lesson)
 - Conductive Materials (playdough, gummy candies, lemons, metals, bananas, etc)
 
####Handouts and Media:

 - [Electricity Challenges worksheet](http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/02/Electricity-Challenge.docx)
 - [Scratch piano for Makey Makey](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2543877/) or the [Makey Makey Drum Machine[(http://www.makeymakey.com/howto.php) (for the musical playdough challenges)
 - [Tetris game](http://www.freetetris.org/game.php) compatible with Makey Makey

Project Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

## Introduce
1. Review the concepts of electric currents, conductivity, and circuits learned in the prior lesson. Students should remember that in order for circuits to work, they must make a complete loop that connects back to the power source (such as batteries.) 
2. Give the students a brief introduction to the Makey Makey.  Explain how the electrical current leaves the computer through the USB cord, through the wires, through their bodies, and back through the wires to the ground in order to complete a circuit.  When the circuit is complete, the Makey Makey makes the corresponding button on the computer work.

## Explore
Students plug in the Makey Makey following the instructions [here](http://www.makeymakey.com/howto.php).

Makey Makey with alligator clips attached to the arrow keys, space, and click pads.

Next, students attach conductive materials to the other end of the alligator clips attached to the arrow keys, space, and click pads.  Students can hold the metal tip of the alligator clip attached to the section called “Earth” (the black alligator clip in the photo above) and then touch the materials attached to the other alligator clips, to complete the circuit.  By doing this, the Makey Makey becomes an extension of the computer keyboard.

## Inquire
Students work through the Electricity Challenges (see table below).  As students work with the Makey Makey, make sure to explain to them how their circuits are being completed. The team with the most points earns a prize at the end of the day!
