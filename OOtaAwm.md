## Setup
Materials per group:
Conductive materials such as lemons, gummy candies, paper clips, pennies, etc
Conductive playdough (from lesson 1)
Non-conductive materials for students to test (straws, paper, cotton balls, etc)
1 Makey Makey set
Computers with internet access
Handouts and Media:
Scratch is a free browser-based programming tool that can be found here
Sample pacman maze (click the blue “See Inside” button to see the code)
Project Time:
1 hour 30 minutes

## Introduce
Show students a short video introduction to Scratch.  Next, students work through the 10 Tips on the online Scratch interface.

## Inquire
Review the code in the example Pacman maze to make sure that students understand the functions of the individual code blocks. Show students how to draw their own sprite (Scratch characters), or pick from the pre-made sprites. 
Review the code that makes the Pacman stop when it hits the walls of the maze:

There is a tiny black dot in front of the Pacman’s mouth (see picture below.)  These code blocks say that the Pacman can keep moving indefinitely (forever) whenever the color black (the dot) is touching green (the maze path).  Note that the obstacles and the walls of the maze are not the same shade of green, so when the Pacman hits them, it cannot keep going.
