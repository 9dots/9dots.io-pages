## Setup
####Materials per group:

 - Conductive materials such as lemons, gummy candies, paper clips, pennies, etc
 - Conductive playdough (from lesson 1)
 - Non-conductive materials for students to test (straws, paper, cotton balls, etc)
 - 1 Makey Makey set
 - Computers with internet access
 
####Handouts and Media:
 - Scratch is a free browser-based programming tool that can be found [here](http://scratch.mit.edu) 
 - [Sample pacman maze](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13930488/) (click the blue “See Inside” button to see the code)
 
Project Time:
1 hour 30 minutes

## Introduce
Show students a [short video introduction to Scratch](http://vimeo.com/65583694).  Next, students work through the 10 Tips on the online Scratch interface.

## Inquire
Review the code in the example Pacman maze to make sure that students understand the functions of the individual code blocks. Show students how to draw their own sprite (Scratch characters), or pick from the pre-made sprites. 
Review the code that makes the Pacman stop when it hits the walls of the maze:

There is a tiny black dot in front of the Pacman’s mouth (see picture below.)  These code blocks say that the Pacman can keep moving indefinitely (forever) whenever the color black (the dot) is touching green (the maze path).  Note that the obstacles and the walls of the maze are not the same shade of green, so when the Pacman hits them, it cannot keep going.

## Innovate
Students design their own mazes that can be navigated using the arrow keys or the MaKey MaKey.

To make a maze, students create two sprites: the maze itself, and a sprite (character) that will be navigating the maze. Students try out the maze by navigating the sprite using the arrow keys. Students add code to make the sprite stop when it runs into walls (and can add a funny sound effect as well when that happens.)

After figuring out how to build the maze in Scratch, students hook up the MaKey MaKey and make a game controller for more interactive fun!
Some ideas for making a game controller include:

 - Making playdough in the shape of the arrow keys

 - Making an aluminum foil and paper joystick
 - Hooking up conductive materials to the ends of the alligator clips

## Discuss
Students have 5 minutes to look around at other students’ mazes.

1.  What could students add in the future to make their mazes more challenging or more engaging?
