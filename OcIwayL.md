##	Lesson

### Explain: 
_What is an app?_
An app (or application) is a computer program that is designed to be used by the consumer.

_What are some examples of applications?_
There are camera application like Photobooth, web browsing applications such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, games such as Angry Birds or Minecraft, and millions of things beyond that.

### DISCUSS: 
_How do people hear about new applications?_

- Market applications (e.g. Google Play, Apple App Store)
- Word of mouth
- Internet searches

###Think - Pair - Share:
Together with a classmate discuss the question, "_How important is it to you that an application has a website that looks nice?_"

### EXPLORE:
Distribute the brainstorming handout.  Students have 2 minutes to do a gallery walk around the room to all the computers with example websites open on them. Using their handout, students will record their favorite and least favorite websites.  When they return to their seats, the teacher will take a survey and chart out their 3 favorite sites and the 3 that they liked the least.  What do their favorites have in common with each other? Why were the 3 they liked the least not pleasant?

### INNOVATE:
Students will now take 5 minutes to come up with 3 ideas for apps that they would like to make a website for. The ideas should have a name as well as reasons why people would use the app.

### GROUP UP:
Students should now talk to their partner and share their ideas.  Within their group they will discuss the ideas and possible improvements or tweaks that could make their ideas even better.

### SHARE:
With their ideas polished, each student will tell the group about one of their applications.  They should share the name and explain to the group why they would want to use this app.
