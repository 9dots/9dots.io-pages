##	Lesson

### Explain: 
_What is an app?_
When you turn a computer on there is a lot of software that runs behind the scenes to make the computer person friendly. That software is called an operating system. Examples of popular operating systems include Windows, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS.  Unfortunately none of that software allows the user to do anything useful.  Thankfully, there is also software that is created to accomplish useful tasks beyond running the computer itself.  This software is called an application and it is what makes computers so useful and fun.  Everything you use to play or work on a computer is done through an application. There are camera application like Photobooth, web browsing applications such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, games such as Angry Birds or Minecraft, and millions of things beyond that.

### DISCUSS: 
_How do people hear about new applications?_
Sometimes there are applications to find out about new applications like on a smartphone in the app market.  A lot of times though you can use the internet to search for a new application.  For instance, when searching for a new game to play, it is common to search on Google and click on links to check out what the game is like.

How important is it to you that an application has a website that looks nice?



### EXPLORE:
Distribute the brainstorming handout.  Students have 2 minutes to do a gallery walk around the room to all the computers with example websites open on them. Using their handout, students will record their favorite and least favorite websites.  When they return to their seats, the teacher will take a survey and chart out their 3 favorite sites and the 3 that they liked the least.  What do their favorites have in common with each other? Why were the 3 they liked the least not pleasant?

### INNOVATE:
Students will now take 5 minutes to come up with 3 ideas for apps that they would like to make a website for. The ideas should have a name as well as reasons why people would use the app.

### GROUP UP:
Students should now talk to their partner and share their ideas.  Within their group they will discuss the ideas and possible improvements or tweaks that could make their ideas even better.

### SHARE:
With their ideas polished, each student will tell the group about one of their applications.  They should share the name and explain to the group why they would want to use this app.
