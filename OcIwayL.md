## Engage - 5 minutes
Get students thinking about websites and applications by discussing with them what a computer application is. 

1. _What is an app?_
	- An app (or application) is a computer program that is designed to be used by the consumer.

2. _What are some examples of applications?_
	- There are camera application like Photobooth, web browsing applications such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, games such as Angry Birds or Minecraft, and millions of things beyond that.

## Explain - 20 minutes
Students inspect examples of good and bad website and use the  [brainstorming handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oi8d7pz.pdf) to write down their three favorite and three least favorite websites.

1. _How do people hear about new applications?_
	- Market applications (e.g. Google Play, Apple App Store)
    - Word of mouth
    - Internet searches

2. Together with a classmate, students discuss the question, "_How important is it to you that an application has a website that looks nice?_"

3. Distribute the brainstorming handout.  Students have 2 minutes to do a gallery walk around the room to all the computers with example websites open on them. 
	- Using their handout, students record their favorite and least favorite websites.  

4. When they return to their seats, take a survey and chart out students' 3 favorite sites and the 3 that they liked the least.  
    - What do their favorites have in common with each other? Why were the 3 they liked the least not pleasant?

## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Now that students have seen examples of application websites, they brainstorm ideas for an original application that they are creating a website for. 

1. Students now take 5 minutes to come up with 3 ideas for apps that they would like to make a website for. The ideas should have a name as well as reasons why people would use the app.

2. Students now talk to their partner and share their ideas.  Within their group they discuss the ideas and possible improvements or tweaks that could make their ideas even better.

## Evaluate - 10 minutes
With their ideas polished, each student tells the group about one of their applications.  They should share the name and explain to the group why they would want to use this app.
