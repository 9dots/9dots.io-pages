- [Inkscape software](http://www.inkscape.org/en/download/)

## Lesson

### DO NOW:
Student will take a couple of minutes to write down on a piece of paper the answer to the question, 'What is a prototype? What is the advantage to creating one before making a website?'

### DISCUSS:
_What is missing from their prototype?_
Students will recognize that there are no images yet. To add images they will use the clipart from inkscape. To access it they will go to File > Import From Open Clipart Library. Once the image is imported, students will use the select tool to resize the image.

### EXPLORE:
Once the students have imported their images, students will continue to customize their prototype in Inkscape. Students should add captions to their images and write small blurbs describing their application. Encourage students to rearrange their website to make them their own.

### EXPAND:
If students finish their prototypes, remind them that a website normally has several pages. They can create a new Inkscape image to design a secondary page for their website.

### PREVIEW: 
Take the last 5 minutes to discuss how the prototype will help create their website. To create a website we write in a computer language that is called HTML. When you an internet browser such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox goes to a website, the website sends the browser HTML code. The internet browser then deciphers the code and displays HTML as elements on the page. An element is anything that is shown on the website such as text, image, or a section to help organize both of them together. Each section of your prototype will be a different line of HTML code.
