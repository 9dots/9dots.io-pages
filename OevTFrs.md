## Lesson Overview
Students finish creating their prototypes from the [Designer](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OeAmgrD) lesson. Students learn how to add images to their site and get a preview of how these prototypes help create websites. Students demonstrate learning by developing a completed prototype for their website with images, text, and headers.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Computers with internet access
- [Inkscape software](http://www.inkscape.org/en/download/)

### Preparations:

- N/A

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes 
Student take a couple of minutes to write down on a piece of paper the answer to the question, 'What is a prototype? What is the advantage to creating one before making a website?'

## Explain - 5 minutes
Discuss what is missing from their prototypes and how to add images to their prototype using the clipart library.

1. Ask students, _"What is missing from their prototype?"_
	- Guide students to the fact that there are no images yet. 

2. To add images use the clipart from inkscape. To access it students click on File > Import From Open Clipart Library.

3. Once the image is imported, students use the select tool to resize the image.

## Elaborate - 30 minutes
Once the students have imported their images, they continue to customize their prototype in Inkscape. 

- Students should add captions to their images and write small blurbs describing their application. 
- Encourage students to rearrange their website to make them their own.

## Extension

** Individual students**

If students finish their prototypes, remind them that a website normally has several pages. They can create a new Inkscape image to design a secondary page for their website.

** Whole class **

Take the 5 minutes to discuss how the prototype helps create their website.

- A website is created using a computer language that is called HTML. 
- When an internet browser such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox goes to a website, the website sends the browser HTML code. 
- The internet browser then deciphers the code and displays HTML as elements on the page. 
- An element is anything that is shown on the website such as text, image, or a section to help organize both of them together.
- Each section of the prototype will be a different line of HTML code.
