## Setup

### Materials:

- Computers with internet access
- [Publication goals worksheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og99y6E.pdf)
- [CSS cheat sheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og9AIaT.pdf)
- [Website flowchart](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og9A5PZ.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Print publication goals
- Print the website publication flowchart
- Print the CSS cheat sheet

### Project Time:

- 2 hours

## Step 1 - HTML
For the first workday, students focus on typing their translated HTML documents in on Codepen. Using the [publication goals worksheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og99y6E.pdf) students develop their original website to meet the goals of the unit.

1. Over the course of the unit students have learned all of the skills you need to create your website. With the translated prototypes, students see their websites become a reality when they input their code into codepen. 

2. Hand out the [publication goals worksheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og99y6E.pdf) and the [CSS cheat sheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Og9AIaT.pdf). As web designers, students need to make sure to create a website that they are proud of. The more time that they put into their website the better it will look. With that in mind there are some basic goals that their website must meet. Use this handout to ensure that your website is complete. Students list the elements on their website and the CSS properties and values that they are changing. 

3. Show students the website publication workflow handout. Explain that with the 4 lessons that remain, students will move through the chart at their own pace. As they finish one step they should move on to the next one. It is important for students to continue working after they finish a step because they have entire website to design!

4. By the end of today, students have all of their HTML translated and type into codepen. When this is completed, students begin styling their website with CSS.

## Step 2 - Images and CSS
When students finish adding their HTML, they style their website using CSS and add images to the site.

1. Now that the HTML is inputted, students are adding images to their site.
	- When they want to add an image they will need to have an instructor help them perform an image search on google. 

2. To add an image:
	1. Perform an image search
	2. Click on the desired image
	3. Click the ‘View Image’ button that appears 
	4. Copy the url (the address in the box at the top of the page) and paste it as the source (src=“url”) on their website.
```
TIP: Using the term 'clipart' with the image seach will help ensure that it return appropriate images
```

3. Hand the students their filled in Publication Goals handout. Using their written responses and the CSS cheat sheet, students begin styling their website. Students should not settle on the first value they assign to each property, trying out several  is an important step in designing a website. 

## Step 3 - Present
Using the projector in the classroom, each student displays their website for the class to see and tells the group about their design choices and the application that their website is for.
