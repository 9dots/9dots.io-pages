## Lesson

### CONNECT:
Over the course of the unit students have learned all of the skills you need to create your website. With the translated prototypes, students will see their websites become a reality when they input their code into codepen. 

### EXPLAIN:
Hand out the Publication Goals worksheet and the CSS cheat sheet. As web designers, students need to make sure to create a website that they are proud of. The more time that they put into their website the better it will look. With that in mind there are some basic goals that their website must meet. Use this handout to ensure that your website is complete. Students will list the elements on their website and the CSS properties and values that they will change. 

### MOVING FORWARD:
Show students the website publication workflow handout. Explain that with the 4 lessons that remain, students will move through the chart at their own pace. As they finish one step they should move on to the next one. It is important for students to continue working after they finish a step because they have entire website to design!

### GOALS:
By the end of today, students will have all of their HTML translated and type into codepen. When this is completed, student will begin styling their website with CSS.
