### MOTIVATE:
Hand out the flow charts and ask students how far along they are.  Today they will be attempting to style their website. By then end of the lesson they should have at least two element on their page completely styled. Today will also be the first day for students to add images to their websites. When they want to add an image they will need to have an instructor help them perform an image search on google. 

### IMAGES:
To add an image, first students will need to perform an image search. Once an appropriate image is found, students will click on it and then click the ‘View Image’ button that appears. The image will become fullscreen.  Once they are on that page students will copy the url (the address in the box at the top of the page) and paste it as the source (src=“url”) on their website.

### CSS:
Hand the students their filled in Publication Goals handout. Using their written responses and the CSS cheat sheet, students will begin styling their website. It is important to remind them that trying a lot of different values will be useful in find the best one to suit their website.  The more they try the better their website will look. Students should make sure to use the flowchart to ensure that they are completing all of the steps.
