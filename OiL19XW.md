- [Game design 3 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OzCotit.pdf)

### Lesson Time:

1. Using the handout, students decide on a theme for their game.

2. Students have multiple levels designed but no way to link them together to make one cohesive game.

## Prototype - 35 minutes

1. Distribute students designs from the first two lessons.

2. Students create their levels on gamefroot according to their theme options from today’s handout and the designs from the previous lessons.

3. Students should test their levels as they are making them to ensure that the the level can be completed and is fun to play.

4. After they have tested their levels, students add the script from their handouts to link their levels together.

## Test

1. Students test their game by pressing the play button.

2. Students adjust their levels to get the difficulty correct.
