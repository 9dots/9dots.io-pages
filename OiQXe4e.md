## Lesson Overview
This lesson will serve as an introduction to programming using the EV3 software (this is useable with the older NXT bricks as well). To start, students will learn about what it means to be a programmer. Next, students learn about their goal for the day, and construct a lego attachment to help achieve it. After, students will learn about simple and complex robot behaviors. To finish the lesson, students will have their first programming challenge to guide their teacher through a maze using programming instructions.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with [EV3 Software](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/software/ddsoftwaredownload/download-software/) 
- Teacher-created maze (black electrical tape on the floor works well)
- Completed Mindstorm [robot from lesson 1](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OJ8iMiY)
- [Programming Introduction Video](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/introtoprogramming/videos/fundamentals1.html)
- [Handout for robotic behaviors](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiQdggn.pdf) 
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiQe49h.pdf)

### Project time:

- 45 min
    
    
## Engage
Give students an introduction to what it means to program robots and discuss the goal for this lesson.

1. Start a discussion with students by asking, _"What do programmers do?"_
	- Programmers give detailed instructions to computers to solve problems and accomplish tasks.  

2. Show the [Programming Introduction Video](http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/previews/robot_c_products/teaching_rc_lego_v2_preview/fundamentals/introtoprogramming/videos/fundamentals1.html).

3. Tell students that their goal is to create a robot that is capable of pushing a lego through a maze without crossing any of the lines. 

```
TIP: Make sure to start the robot in the exact same place each time. Placing an extra piece of tape in the starting area to mark the correct position can help ensure consistency.

**Above: An example of what the maze could look like. The robot will have to push the lego from the green ‘Start’ zone to the red ‘Finish’  zone without crossing the lines.**

## Explore
Students will take to the engineering side of robotics to develop an attachment to help accomplish their goal.

1. A robot attachment is an additional part made out of legos that can easily be connected to the robot to help complete a specific goal. 

2. To push legos, students will need to build an attachment that keeps legos from getting trapped under the robot or lost while turning.

3. Break students in to groups of no more than four

4. Groups now have 10 minutes to develop an attachment that is capable of pushing legos.

## Explain
Students will learn about discuss programming and learn about simple and complex robotic behaviors.

1. Discuss with students, _"Now that the robot has an attachment to push the lego, how will the robot know what to do?"_
	- The robot needs to be programmed to accomplish the goal of getting through the maze.

2. Check for understanding by asking, "_What does programming mean?_"
	- Programming means giving the computer detailed instructions to solve problems.  

3. In robotics, these instructions that are given to the robot are called behaviors.

4. Pass out the Behaviors handout and use it as a guide to discuss simple and complex behaviors in robotics.

5. Gauge understanding by asking, "_Is navigating the maze a simple or complex behavior?_"
	- Going through the maze is complex because it is made up of several different programmable steps.

## Elaborate
Play a game in which students program the instructor to move through a maze like the robot.

1. Break into groups of no more than four students. 

2. Students have 5 minutes to program the teacher robot (you) to go through the robot maze. 
	- The teacher robot only understands the simple behaviors:
		1. Move Straight (1 step forward)
		2. Turn Left (90 degrees)
		3. Turn Right (90 degrees)
 
3. After surverying the maze, each group will write down their instructions on a piece of paper. 

4. After students have their instructions written down, groups will take turns having the teacher robot act out their program. 
	- When behaving as the robot, make sure to follow the instructions very literally.

## Test/Feedback 

### Discussion Questions:

- _What is the difference between a simple and a complex behavior?_
	- A simple behavior is a single programmable action, a complex behavior is made up of two or more simple behaviors.
    
- _What does a programmer do?_
	- A programmer gives detailed instructions to computers to make computers useful to users.
