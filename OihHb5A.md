title: Review of Move and Wait
blurb: "This lesson combines the maze of the first lesson with the use of touch sensors in the second lesson to review the programming that students learned. Students review the move steering and wait blocks by playing a game of #Mindstorm says. Students demonstrate learning by programming a robot to move through a maze while using the touch sensor to know when to turn."

## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm NXT kit
- Computer with NXT software
- Teacher-created maze
- [Daily wrap up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihIq1N.pdf)
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihHr6T.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Create a maze with walls for a robot to bump in to
- Print the wrap up and iteration log handouts

### Project time:

- 50 min

## Engage - 5 minutes
Students have a do-now to answer review questions and then explain to them their goal for this lesson.

1. Students answer the following questions on a piece of paper at the beginning of the lesson:
	- _How can the robot be programmed to move in reverse?_
    
	- _How can the robot be programmed to turn?_
    
	- _How do you change the duration of the move block?_

2. Tell students that their goal is to create a robot that is capable of going through a maze by using the walls to direct itself. Bonus points are awarded for each wall that the robot touches.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Use a game of mindstorm says to review the programming blocks that students learned in previous lessons.

1. Start a game of mindstorm says to check for understanding.  The rules are the same as in the previous lesson. To recap:
  - **Move block:** Walk in place.
      - For each rotation specified the students take 1 step.
      - If the paper says unlimited the students continue to walk in place until told otherwise.
  - **Wait block with touch sensor:** A tap on the head activates the studentâ€™s touch sensor. Students now move on to the next step in the program.
  - **Loop:** Any parts of the program that are between the start and end of loop pages should be repeated until the teacher says to stop.

## Elaborate - 30 minutes
Students program their robot and use practice runs to improve their solution.

1. Each group has 35 minutes to program the robot to complete the maze. Points for the robots are rewarded for:
	- 10 points for each wall the robot bumps.
    - 50 points for finishing the maze in the correct area.

2. After each attempt, students write down what worked and what needs to change using the [iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihHr6T.pdf). 

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test the student programming solutions and then students fill out their robotics wrap up.

1. At the end of the 35 minutes, each group tests their robot and record their points.

2. Students finish their robotics [wrap-up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihIq1N.pdf).
