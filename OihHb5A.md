## Materials:
- Lego Mindstorm NXT kit
- Computer with NXT software
- Teacher-created maze

## Media and Handouts:
- Iteration and wrap-up handout

## Project time:
1 hr 15 min

## Lesson Plan

### DO NOW:
Students will answer the following questions on a piece of paper at the beginning of the lesson:

_How can the robot be programmed to move in reverse?_

_How can the robot be programmed to turn?_

_How do you change the duration of the move block?_


### EXPLAIN:
Tell students that their goal is to create a robot that is capable of going through a maze by using the walls to direct itself. Bonus points will be awarded for each wall that the robot touches.

### PLAY:
Start a game of mindstorm says to check for understanding.  The rules will be the same as in the previous lesson.


### PROGRAM:
Each group has 35 minutes to program the robot to complete the maze. Points for the robots will be rewarded for:
- 10 points for each wall the robot bumps.
- 50 points for finishing the maze in the correct area.

After each attempt, students write down what worked and what needs to change using this handout. At the end of the allotted time, each group tests their robot and record their points.

### WRAP-UP:
Students should now finish their robotics wrap-up handout.
