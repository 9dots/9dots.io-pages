title: Review of Move and Wait
blurb: "This lesson will solidify the students understanding of the move block and challenged them to move the #robot through a maze."
org: 9dots
objective: "By the end of the class, students will be able to demonstrate learning by using the move and wait blocks to move a robot through the maze."

## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm NXT kit
- Computer with NXT software
- Teacher-created maze
- [Daily wrap up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihIq1N.pdf)
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihHr6T.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Create a maze with walls for a robot to bump in to
- Print the wrap up and iteration log handouts

### Project time:

- 45 min

## Engage

1. Students will answer the following questions on a piece of paper at the beginning of the lesson:
	- _How can the robot be programmed to move in reverse?_
    
	- _How can the robot be programmed to turn?_
    
	- _How do you change the duration of the move block?_

2. Tell students that their goal is to create a robot that is capable of going through a maze by using the walls to direct itself. Bonus points will be awarded for each wall that the robot touches.

## Explain

1. Start a game of mindstorm says to check for understanding.  The rules will be the same as in the previous lesson. To recap:
  - **Move block:** Walk in place.
      - For each rotation specified the students take 1 step.
      - If the paper says unlimited the students continue to walk in place until told otherwise.
  - **Wait block with touch sensor:** A tap on the head activates the studentâ€™s touch sensor. Students will now move on to the next step in the program.
  - **Loop:** Any parts of the program that are between the start and end of loop pages should be repeated until the teacher says to stop.

## Elaborate

1. Each group has 35 minutes to program the robot to complete the maze. Points for the robots will be rewarded for:
	- 10 points for each wall the robot bumps.
    - 50 points for finishing the maze in the correct area.

2. After each attempt, students write down what worked and what needs to change using the [iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihHr6T.pdf). 

3. At the end of the 35 minutes, each group tests their robot and record their points.

4. Students finish their robotics [wrap-up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihIq1N.pdf).
