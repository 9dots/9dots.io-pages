## Lesson Overview
This lesson focuses on using the infrared sensor to watch for obstacles in the path of the robot. Start by relating the infrared sensor to the human sense of sight. Then, tell students that the goal for today is to build a robot that can drive around while avoiding obstacles in its path. Show students how to change the wait block to use the infrared sensor. Students demonstrate learning by creating a robot that continuously avoid obstacles while driving for 1 minute.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihTVR8.pdf)
- [Daily wrap-up log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OihTWZw.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Print the interation log and daily wrap-up handouts

### Project time:

- 1 hr 20 min

## Engage - 5 minutes
Get students thinking about the challenge by discussing the senses needed to avoid obstacles. After relating the infrared sensor to human sight, reveal the challenge for this lesson.

1. _What senses are used to avoid walking into objects?_
Eyes allow humans to see obstacles before running into them.

2. _Which attachment can give the robot the ability to avoid objects?_
The infrared sensor gives the robot the ability to sense objects that are in itâ€™s path.

3. Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEwIFIOoZPU)  of a robot avoiding obstacle.

4. Tell students that the goal for this lesson is to build a robot that continuously avoid obstacles for 1 minutes while the power never goes below 50.

## Explore - 15 minutes
Students now have 15 minutes to attempt to build an infrared attachment for the robot. It is important for the sensor to be located on the front of the robot so that it can get an accurate reading as to how far away obstacles are.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Show students how to use the wait block with the infrared sensor. Students should already have a strong understanding of the wait block from the [Mindstorm Pinball](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQezr2) and [Review of Move and Wait Blocks](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OihHb5A) lessons. 

1. _What knowledge from previous lessons can help complete the goal?_
By using a combination of the move, wait, and loop block, the robot can be programmed to continuously avoid the obstacles in your path.

2. _What will need to be changed to make the wait block work for the infrared sensor?_
	1. Click to switch the sensor to the infrared sensor
    2. Select compare
    3. Select proximity

## Elaborate - 35 minutes
Remind students about the goal for their robot and give them time to program the robot and test out their designs.

1. **The setup for the competition:** 
Each group needs to create a robot capable of avoiding all obstacles for 1 minute while the move power is never below 60. Show the students the field setup with the obstacles (picture). 

2. Each group has 35 minutes to program their robot and test them. 

3. After each attempt, students write down what worked and what they should change using this handout. 

## Evaluate - 10 minutes
Now that the students programs are finished and attachments are developed, test their robots. When they are done, students finish with the wrap-up handout.
