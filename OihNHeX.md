## Materials:
- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software

## Media and Handouts:
- Iteration and wrap-up handout

## Project time:
1 hr 15 min

##Lesson Plan

### DISCUSS:

_What senses are used to avoid walking into objects?_
Eyes allow humans to see obstacles before running into them.

_Which attachment can give the robot the ability to avoid objects?_
The infrared sensor will give the robot the ability to sense objects that are in itâ€™s path.

### HOOK:
Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEwIFIOoZPU)  of a robot avoiding obstacle.

### BUILD:
Students now have 15 minutes to attempt to build an infrared attachment for the robot. It is important for the sensor to be located on the front of the robot so that it can get an accurate reading as to how far away obstacles are.


### DISCUSS:
_What knowledge from previous lessons can help complete the goal?_
By using a combination of the move, wait, and loop block, the robot can be programmed to continuously avoid the obstacles in your path.

_What will need to be change to make the wait block work for the infrared sensor?_

### PROGRAM:
**The setup for the competition:** 
Each group needs to create a robot capable of avoiding all obstacles for 1 minute while the move power is never below 60. Show the students the field setup with the obstacles (picture). Each group has 35 minutes to program their robot and test them. After each attempt, students should write down what worked and what they should change using this handout. At the end of the allotted time, there will be a competition to make sure that their robots can avoid all of the obstacles for the entire minute

### WRAP-UP:
Students should now finish their robotics wrap-up handout.
