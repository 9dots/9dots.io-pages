## Lesson Overview


## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiHcB8.pdf)
- [Daily wrap-up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiHdDi.pdf)

### Project time:

- 1 hr 20 min

## Engage - 10 minutes
Start the lesson by discussing how a robot could manipulate objects it encounters. Then tell students about their goal for this lesson.

1. Begin by disucssing with students, "_How do you pick things up off the ground?_"

2. Follow up with, "_How could a robot accomplish this task?_"
	- By using the servo motors, it is possible to create an arm that is capable of picking up or dragging objects.

3. Show students the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfahK5UX6Lg) of a robot using a motorized arm.

4. Today, students are building a robot with a motorized arm capable of dragging legos and bring them to a specified location.

5. **The setup for the competition:** 
Each group is a team sent from NASA to perform experiment on the moon. Unfortunately, as they were landing, some of their resources got scattered across the moon and they need them back quickly. The only solution is to build a robot capable of bringing the resources back to the base as quickly as possible. Show the students the mat and where the various pieces are set up.

## Explore - 15 minutes
Using the medium motor, students have 15 minutes to build a motorized arm for their robot that is capable of [dragging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs8mh3skPGw) legos.

```
If you are using an NXT kit, use the normal motor in place of the medium of the motor.
```

## Explain - 10 minutes
Students learn how to use the medium motor block to control the arm on their robot. Using this information, students write the steps to gather the first lego and check it with the group.

1. To program their arm, students will need to use medium motor block.

2. Switch the medium motor block to 'On for degrees' so that the arm doesn't spin too far

3. Using negative numbers switches the direction that the arm moves.

4. Give students time to write a list of simple behaviors to collect the first lego.

5. Review the instructions that the students have generated

## Elaborate - 35 minutes
Students write down the behaviors for the robot on paper and then translate that to the Mindstorm programming blocks.

1. Each group now has 35 minutes to finish building a motorized arm and program their robot to complete the goal. 

2. Before programming, students write all of the instructions for the robot down on paper.

3. After each attempt, students should write down what worked and what they should change using the handout. 

## Evaluate - 10 minutes
Test the programs created by the students and finish up by having student fill out the robotics wrap-up handout.

1. Test each of the students programs to determine which one brings back the most legos to the base in 1 minute.

2. Students should now finish their [daily wrap-up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiHdDi.pdf).
