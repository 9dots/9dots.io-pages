## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software
- [Iteration log](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiHcB8.pdf)
- [Daily wrap-up handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiHdDi.pdf)

### Project time:

- 1 hr 15 min

## Engage

1. Begin by disucssing with students, "_How do you pick things up off the ground?_"

2. Follow up with, "_How could a robot accomplish this task?_"
	- By using the servo motors, it is possible to create an arm that is capable of picking up or dragging objects.

3. Show students the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfahK5UX6Lg) of a robot using a motorized arm.

4. Today, students are building a robot with a motorized arm capable of dragging legos and bring them to a specified location.

5. **The setup for the competition:** 
Each group is a team sent from NASA to perform experiment on the moon. Unfortunately, as they were landing, some of their resources got scattered across the moon and they need them back quickly. The only solution is to build a robot capable of bringing the resources back to the base as quickly as possible. Show the students the mat and where the various pieces are set up.

## Explore
Using the medium motor, students have 15 minutes to build a motorized arm for their robot that is capable of [dragging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs8mh3skPGw) legos.

```
If you are using an NXT kit, use the normal motor in place of the medium of the motor.
```

## Explain

1. To program their arm, students will need to use medium motor block.

## Elaborate

1. Each group now has 35 minutes to finish building a motorized arm and program their robot to complete the goal. 

2. After each attempt, students should write down what worked and what they should change using the handout. 

## Evaluate

1. At the end of the allotted time, there will be a competition to determine which robot collects the most resources in 1 minute.

2. Students should now finish their robotics wrap-up handout.
