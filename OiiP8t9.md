title: Robotics Competition
blurb: "To finish the robotics unit, students compete in a series of programming challenges. Start by reviewing what students have learned about robotics. Then, introduce students to the challenges for the final competition. Students demonstrate learning by engineering and programming a robot to complete the challenges."

## Setup

### Materials:

- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software
- [Robotics scoring handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiiSMQe.pdf)

### Project time:

- 1 hr

### Preparations:

- Print robotics scoring handouts

## Engage - 10 minutes
Review the engineering and programming that students have learned about in this unit and discuss the goals for this lesson.

1. _Which Mindstorm attachments have you learned to use?_
	- Students have learned how to make a push attachment, a light sensor,  the touch sensor, and a motorized arm.

2. _Which programming blocks have you learned?_
	- The move block, the wait, the switch, and the loop.

3. Today, students use all of the skills that were just discussed, to compete in a series of robotics challenges.  They have three possible challenges and can attempt as many as they would like in the project time.

4. Each group recieves a scoring handout for the instructor to fill out during tests.

## Explain - 5 minutes
Show the students the challenges that they are working on and discuss the points that each is worth.

1. Bring all of the people to the red zone.
	- For the first challenge, construct an arm for the robot that is capable of recovering the lego people and bringing them back to the base. Once they are returned, program the robot to travel across the field to the red zone without running into any of the cars or obstacles on the way.

2. Follow the line
	- Using the light sensor and a different course, students attempt to follow a black line through a maze without touching any walls. The scoring works as follows:
		- 50 points for the robot finishing in the red zone
        - -5 points for any box that is touched
        - 30 bonus points to the team with the fastest time

**ABOVE: Example of what they line following maze can look like. A black line across the maze with walls (boxes) to make sure that the robot is sticking close to the line. Students start at the green start zone and finish in the red zone.**

3. Mindstorm Pinball
	- The last goal is to play a game of mindstorm pinball and collect as many points as possible. The points are awarded for: 
		- 1st time bouncing off of a wall: 10 points
        - 2nd time bouncing off of the same wall:  5 points
        - 3rd + time bouncing off of the same wall: 1 point
        - 50 bonus point each time all four walls are hit

## Elaborate - 40 minutes
Students have the entire project time to work on all of the challenges. As they complete a challenge, students can ask to have their robot evaluated.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
At the end of the time, the scores are tallied and an overall robotics competition winner is announced.

## Standards
Standard | Description | Connection
-------- | ----------- | ----------
NGSS-MS-ETS1-3 | Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success. | Evaluate 
CSTA.CT.L2-01 | Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g., problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution, testing, evaluation). | Elaborate
