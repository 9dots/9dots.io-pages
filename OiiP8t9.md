## Materials:
- Lego Mindstorm kit
- Computer with EV3 software

## Media and Handouts
- Iteration and wrap-up handout

##Lesson Plan

### HOOK:
_Which Mindstorm attachments have you learned to use?_
Students have learned how to make a push attachment, a light sensor,  the touch sensor, and a motorized arm.

_Which programming blocks have you learned?_
The move block, the wait, the switch, and the loop.

Today, students will have to use all of the skills that were just discussed, to compete in a series of robotics challenges.  They will have four possible challenges and can attempt as many as they would like in the project time.


## THE CHALLENGES:

### 1) Bring all of the people to the red zone: 50 points
For the first challenge, construct an arm for the robot that is capable of recovering the lego people and bringing them back to the base. Once they are returned, program the robot to travel across the field to the red zone without running into any of the cars or obstacles on the way.

### 2) Follow the line: 50 points

Using the light sensor and a different course, students will attempt to follow a black line through a maze without touching any walls. The scoring will work as follows:

- 50 points for the robot finishing in the red zone
- -5 points for any box that is touched
- 30 bonus points to the team with the fastest time

ABOVE: Example of what they line following maze can look like. A black line across the maze with walls (boxes) to make sure that the robot is sticking close to the line. Students will start at the green start zone and finish in the red zone.

### 3) Make your robot run in to each of the four walls on the game board: 100 points

The last goal will be to play a game of mindstorm pinball and collect as many points as possible.
