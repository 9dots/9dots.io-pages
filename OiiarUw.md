## Setup

### Materials:

- White paper
- [History of animation video](http://mit.tv/Ac9egn)
- [Pixar story video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oggMSPCHNtw)

### Preparation:

- Cut paper into  ~ 3.5in x 4.25in pieces
- Make example flipbook
- Set up projector for videos

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage

1. Show the students clips from 'Paranorman' as and example of movies made using stop motion animation. Over the next 6 weeks, students are making their own stop motion movie.

2. _What is animation?_
	- Animation means to bring something to life. The art of animation has been around for a long time and originally was a way to make still images appear to be moving.

3. Show the [history of animation video](http://mit.tv/Ac9egn) and the [Pixar story video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oggMSPCHNtw). After the videos gauge learning by asking these questions:
	1. _What is the history of animation?_
		- Animation started even before televisions or projectors were invented.  People have been using simple machines like **zoetropes** and **flip books** to make drawings come to life for thousands of years.
	2. _Why do animated drawings seem like they are moving?_
		- Animations like flipbooks work because the human eye remembers the previous picture for about 1/32 second after it is shown; another picture shown quickly appears to be part of the same image.

## Explore

1. As a group, test the concept of afterimage on this website. Students should stare at the black dot in the middle of the screen. After 30 seconds, the image will change and the students will see color even though the new image is black and white.

2. To check for understanind, students share with a partner why they can see colors even after the image becomes black and white.

3. Show the students an example of a flipbook. Flipbooks are a great example of using the concept of afterimage to create animation. By flipping the pages quickly it will appear as if the characters are moving. 

## Elaborate

1. Hand out 10-20 pieces of the pre-cut white paper to each student. On one of the pieces of paper, students draw a first image that the rest of the animation will be based on. 

2. When that is completed, students trace their first image on the next piece of paper BUT change one detail. 
	- The cycle of tracing the previous image but with a small change should continue until the student has used all of his or her paper.  

3. When they have finished, staple the papers together to complete the flipbook.

4. If a student finishes the project early, they can choose to add more pictures to their flip book, add more color to their project, or add a cover page with a title.
