title: Stop Motion Legos
blurb: Students will learn about how to create a stop motion animation with legos and their computers.
org: 9dots
objective: "By the end of the lesson, students will be able to relate the process of creating a stop motion to the process of making the flipbook from lesson 1, and produce a stop motion animation of a lego tower that grows using a computer and legos"

## Lesson Overview
This lesson provides an introduction to creating stop motion animations. Start by showing some examples of famous stop motion films to engage students. Discuss the similarities between stop motion animation and the flipbooks from the [previous lesson](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiiarUw). After learning the process, students demonstrate learning by creating their own simple stop motions using legos.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Legos
- Computers with iMovie and Photobooth

### Stop Motion Examples:
- [Deadline Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWM0FNPZSs)
- [Summer Nights Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyjdt5Qso)
- [In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu0DuxFAT0)
- [Making of In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIH4MJAC2Tg&feature=youtu.be)
- [T-Shirt War Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWdSCt4jGE)
- [Wallace and Gromit Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDhmlMQT60)
- [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI)

### Preparation:
- Ensure all of the computers have iMovie installed
- Separate legos into separate boxes for the groups
- Set up projector to show stop motion examples

### Project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Review what students know about animation from the first lesson and discuss why animations appear to be moving.

1. Review with student by asking, _"What is animation?"_
	- To animate means to bring to life. An animation is the process of making a stationary object appear to move on it's own.

2. _Why did the flipbook animation make it look like the characters were moving?_
	- Afterimage makes it so that our eyes remember the previous picture for about 1/32 second after it is shown. That, combined with the new image, makes it appear as if it moving.


## Explain - 10 minutes
Discuss what a stop motion animation is and show an example of stop motion film making by showing the Box Trolls Trailer.

1. Discuss, _"What is stop motion animation?"_

 - Stop Motion animation is a process that is similar to the flipbook except that instead of flipping a page, the computer will be playing a series of pictures very quickly. An example of an upcoming movie that utilizes stop motion animation is the film Boxtrolls.

2. Over the next six weeks students will be creating their own stop motion animation videos. They will learn how to storyboard, create, and edit their videos. To start watch some examples.

3. Show students the [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI). 
	- When it is finished discuss the attention to detail and patience that goes into making a stop motion video. For further examples, any of the other video from the stop motion examples section above can be shown.

4. To check for understanding, tell students to share with a partner how the process for making a stop motion animation is similar to making a flipbook. 

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
Teach students the step to creating a stop motion and then explain their challenge for this lesson.

1. Distribute the Stop Motion Challenge handout to students. Their goal is to create an animation in which a lego tower builds itself up.

2. The instructions for creating the first stop motion are:
  1. Place the first lego in the view of the camera
  2. Take a picture
  3. Add a lego
  4. Take a picture
  5. Repeats steps 3 and 4 until you have at least 40 pictures and a full lego tower.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

To watch the stop motion:

1. Select the first picture in Photobooth
2. Hold the arrow keys on the keyboard to make the pictures animate just like the flipbook.

## Extension
If a student finishes their first stop motion, create a second animation of the tower falling apart or shrinking using the same process.
