## Introduce

### REVIEW:
_What is stop motion animation?_
Stop motion animation is using a computer to play a series of pictures very quickly to bring stationary objects to life.

### Explain:
In the last lesson, students learned the basics of making a stop motion animation using the computer to capture images and play them back. Today they will learn about how to turn those pictures into a real video using iMovie to edit the video.

_What is video editing?_
Video editing is the process of taking the raw footage from the camera (or computer) and changing it so that the story flows and looks better.

### WATCH:
Show students the trailer for the movie [Coraline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js7wxoqeVK0). Discuss how video editing is used to make this video look and flow together better.

- Video editing is used to put scenes together to get audiences excited about the movie (A series of exciting or mysterious scenes)
- Titles are added in the middle of the trailer to tell the audience more about the movie
- A song is played in the background throughout the trailer
- There are sound effects to make events feel more realisitc

### DISCUSS:
_What can you change in your video using iMovie?_
Using iMovie you can add transitions, background music, voice overs for characters, sound effects, and titles.

### What is a transition?
A transition is a way to combine two scenes without just a hard cut from one clip to another.

### What is a sound effect?
A sound effect is a way to add sounds to the action in a video. For instance if there is a car in your movie you can add a sound of the engine revving up to make the animation feel more real.
