## Setup

### Materials:

- Computers with iMovie
- Example video to edit
- Photobooth pictures from [Stop Motion Legos](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OitXCP0) lesson
- [Video editing checklist](http://uploads.9dots.io/OitnGQF.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Print out [video editing checklist](http://uploads.9dots.io/OitnGQF.pdf)

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage

1. Have the the question, _'What is a transition and what is it used for?'_ written on the board when students enter the class. Students will have 2 minutes to write down the answer on a piece of paper.
	- A transition is an animation that is played in between two video clips to show the viewer that the movie is moving on to the next scene.

2. As a group discuss some questions to review what students learned the week before.
	1. _What are movie titles used for?_
		- The movie titles show information to the audience. They can be used to show the name of the movie, show information such as a location, or run the credits at the end of a movie.

	2. _What is a video clip?_
		- A video clip is a section of video that plays uninterrupted in the movie. These are the building blocks when editing.

	3. _What is a sound effect?_
		- A sound effect is a sound that is added to the movie during editing that was not present while it was being filmed. These are added to make the movie feel more realistic. 

## Elaborate

1. Distribute the stop motion editing checklist. Students apply the editing techniques that they have learned to the stop motion videos that they made in the [Stop Motion Legos](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OitXCP0) lesson. 

2. To move their picture from Photobooth to iMovie, students need to select all of the pictures from Photobooth and drag them into their project in iMovie.

3. The video editing checklist should look like this:
	1. My stopmotion video has:
		- a title screen that has the name of the movie
		- at least 3 transitions that are put between video clips
		- at least 10 sound effects
		- background music
		- movie credits at the end of the movie
