## Work Day

### DO NOW:

- Director
- Animator
- Editor

### WATCH:
A little [stop motion inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkF0oChnSA) to get the students excited about creating their own videos.

### HOOK:
This is the first day of capturing images for their stop motion videos! Before students start to create the movie, they need to understand the different jobs that go into creating a movie. This will enable them to work more quickly and efficiently as a group.

### EXPLAIN:
For this project, student will take turns in the different roles of making this stop motion movie. After finishing each scene, students will switch roles with their partner. For this project there will be two roles.

_What does the director do?_
The director is in charge of taking the written word, and visualizing what it will look like for the movie. This means that while the student is director, he or she is in charge of figuring out how they will create the scene. For this project, the director will also be the one taking the pictures.

_What does the animator do?_
The animator is in charge of moving the characters in the movie around to follow the directors vision of the movie. This is the hands on job. It is important to try to create the scene the way that it has been described by the director.

### CREATE:
Distribute the completed storyboards to each group. Students will decide which roles they will start with and will switch off after each scene. Their goal is to finish taking at least 60 pictures by the end of the class. Remind students that more pictures will make their movies look better and play more smoothly.
