## Setup

### Materials:

- [Stop Motion Inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkF0oChnSA)
- [Wallace and Gromit example dialogue](http://uploads.9dots.io/OxJexi2.mp4)
- [Wallace and Gromit establishing shot](http://uploads.9dots.io/OxJdaSb.mp4)
- Computer with Photo Booth (or other picture taking application)
- Legos
- Playdough
- Markers
- Crayon
- Paper
- Whiteboards

### Preparation:

- Bring completed storyboards

### Project Time:

- 2 hours

## Step 1 - Introduce roles and start taking pictures

1. As students enter the class, they have 3 minutes to write down what they think the roles are for the following jobs:
	- Director
	- Animator
	- Editor

2. A little [stop motion inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkF0oChnSA) to get the students excited about creating their own videos.

3. This is the first day of capturing images for their stop motion videos! Before students start to create the movie, they need to understand the different jobs that go into creating a movie. This will enable them to work more quickly and efficiently as a group.

4. For this project, student take turns in the different roles of making this stop motion movie. After finishing each scene, students switch roles with their partner. For this project there are two roles.
	- _What does the director do?_
		- The director is in charge of taking the written word, and visualizing what it will look like for the movie. This means that while the student is director, he or she is in charge of figuring out how they will create the scene. For this project, the director will also be the one taking the pictures.
	- _What does the animator do?_
		- The animator is in charge of moving the characters in the movie around to follow the directors vision of the movie. This is the hands on job. It is important to try to create the scene the way that it has been described by the director.

5. Distribute the completed storyboards to each group. Students decide which roles they start with and switch off after each scene. Their goal is to finish taking at least 60 pictures by the end of the class. Remind students that stop motion movies with more pictures look better and play more smoothly than movies with less.

## Step 2 - Add dialogue

1. Watch an example of stop motion dialogue with [Wallace and Gromit](http://uploads.9dots.io/OxJexi2.mp4). 

2. Dialogue is a conversation between two people. When two people are talking in a movie, it is common for the camera to switch from one side to the other. 

3. To create a scene with dialogue, students set up their subjects facing one another. The camera (computer) starts on one side so that only one of their characters’ (subject A) face is showing. Students take 20-30 pictures moving subject A to make them appear to be talking. After 20-30 pictures, students move the computer to the other side so that subject B’s face is showing. Another 20-30 pictures should be taken with subject be doing the talking. This process can repeat for as long as the students need the conversation to continue.
```
TIP: Mark where the camera was with tape so that when the conversation moves back and forth, the camera angles are always the same.
```

4. Students work on capturing more pictures for their stop motion videos. Students should strive to have at least 140 pictures captured with at least one scene with dialogue.

## Step 3 - Establishing shots

1. _What is an establishing shot?_
	- An establishing shot is a wide shot at the beginning of a scene that shows the location of a scene or the time at which it is happening (day or night) before switching to closer shots with the subjects of the film. Film makers often use an establishing shot to let the audience know where the action is taking place.

2. Check out the examples of establishing shots used in [Spiderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmF-PBPLlcA) and [Wallace and Gromit](http://uploads.9dots.io/OxJdaSb.mp4). Notice how the first shots do not show the characters, but instead show the location and whether it is daytime or nighttime.

3. Students should add at least one establishing shot and finish taking at least 200 pictures.
