## Setup

### Materials:

- Wallace and Gromit
- Computer with Photo Booth (or other picture taking application)
- Legos
- Playdough
- Markers
- Crayon
- Paper
- Whiteboards

### Preparation:

- Bring completed storyboards

## Work Day

### DO NOW:
When students enter the class they will answer the question, “What is dialogue?”

### HOOK:
Watch an example of stop motion dialogue with Wallace and Gromit. 

### EXPLAIN:
Dialogue is a conversation between two people. When two people are talking in a movie, it is common for the camera to switch from one side to the other. 

### HOW TO:
To create a scene with dialogue, students will set up their subjects facing one another. The camera (computer) will start on one side so that only one of their characters’ (subject A) face is showing. Students will take 20-30 pictures moving subject A to make them appear to be talking. After 20-30 pictures, students will move the computer to the other side so that subject B’s face is showing. Another 20-30 pictures should be taken with subject be doing the talking. This process can repeat for as long as the students need the conversation to continue.

```
TIP: Mark where the camera was with tape so that when the conversation moves back and forth, the camera angles are always the same.
```

### CREATE:
For the rest of the time, students will work on capturing more pictures for their stop motion videos. Students should strive to have at least 140 pictures captured by the end of this lesson.
