## Setup

### MATERIALS:

- Computers with internet access
- [Game design 2 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OzCXr0h.docx)
- [Mario level 1-1 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsC0zIhWNww)
- [Super Mario Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH2wGpEZVgE)

### LESSON TIME: 

- 45 minutes

## Introduce - 10 minutes

1. Start by showing the clip of Mario to engage students in thinking about how to teach a player how to jump in their game.

2. Using the [Game design day 2 handout], students identify what parts of the game show good level design.

3. Watch the [Super Mario Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH2wGpEZVgE) where more of the design attributes can be found.

4. Explain that by creating walls, players can force players to learn how to jump before they can move on in the game.

5. Building a series of walls in increasing height teaches players that holding the jump button allows them to jump higher.

6. Once the player has been taught how to jump in one level, the next level can introduce the concept of jumping over a gap.

## Define - 5 minutes
What are the problems that students need to solve with their design.

- Teach the player how high their character can jump
- Teach the player how far their character can jump

## Ideate - 10 minutes

1. Students draw ideas for the two levels. 
	- Remind students that they are making a platformer so the game will be oriented left to right and needs to have a goal that the character moves towards.

2. The first level should have an escalating series of walls for the character to jump over on the way to the goal.

3. The second level should have a series of gaps in increasing length for the character to jump over on the way to the goal.

## Prototype - 15 minutes
1. Students create their levels on gamefroot.
To start students need to add terrain by selecting it in the left pane and then clicking where they want the level

## Test - 5 minutes
Students test their game by pressing the play button

- If the level is too easy or impossible the students should fix it
- If everything works and they have finished early, students should work on making a level that has multiple layers
