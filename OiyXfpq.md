## Setup

### Materials:

- [Meatboy level design](http://videos.criticalcommons.org/transcoded/http/www.criticalcommons.org/Members/fearv/clips/indie-game-the-movie-edmund-mcmillen-discusses/video_file/webm-high/design-mp4.webm)
- [Game Design Powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/OxsvMBy.pptx)

### LESSON TIME:

- 45 minutes

## Introduce - 10 minutes
Make sure the projector is set up to play the introduction video and show the powerpoint.

1. Introduce the concepts behind game design by showing the [Meatboy level design](http://videos.criticalcommons.org/transcoded/http/www.criticalcommons.org/Members/fearv/clips/indie-game-the-movie-edmund-mcmillen-discusses/video_file/webm-high/design-mp4.webm) video

2. Show the slide that details the level design principles
	- Fun - Good level design is fun to navigate.
	- Show - Good level design always tells the player what to do, but never how to do it.
	- Teach - Good level design constantly teaches the player.
	- Emotion - Good level design creates an emotional connection between the player and the game.
	- Mechanics - Good level design is driven by mechanics.
		- Mechanics are the rules and methods that control how the game works.
        - In the mario clip from above, one example of a mechanic is that when mario eats a mushroom he grows.
        - Another example of a mechanic is that hitting the question mark box releases a prize.

3. Today students are designing the first level of a platformer game that teaches the player how to navigate to the finish.

4. What is a platformer?
	- A platformer is a type of game where you run across the level to get to specific end point like Mario.
	- In this unit students are creating their own platformer games.

## Empathize - 10 minutes

1. Hand out the game design handout

2. In the empathize section of the handout students should write a response to, “What it is like to play a game that they have never played before? How do you learn to play a new game?”

## Define - 5 minutes
What are the problems that students need to solve with their design?

- Teach players to go towards the end of the level.

## Ideate - 10 minutes

1. In the box provided on the handout, students draw ideas for the first level. 

2. Remind students that they are making a platformer so the game is oriented left to right and needs to have a goal that the character moves towards.

3. The level need an item to act as endpoint.

## Prototpe - 15 minutes
Students log in to [gamefroot](http://www.gamefroot.com) to create their first levels. To make this process go faster students use a premade level in which they create a character and a finish zone.

1. Students login to gamefroot.com

2. Students load the premade level

3. Students use the character creator to make their own hero (no guns)

4. Students add a finish area to the end of the level

## Test - 5 minutes
Students try playing their game and note any changes that they would make to it.
