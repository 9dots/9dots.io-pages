## Preparation:

- Bring completed storyboards

## Lesson:

### DO NOW:
Students will take a couple of minutes to write down at least three scenes that they want to complete by the end of the lesson.

### HOOK:
Watch some [stop motion inspiration](http://vimeo.com/1105462) to get the creativity flowing.

### DISCUSS:
_What is an establishing shot?_
An establishing shot is a wide shot at the beginning of a scene that shows the location of a scene or the time at which it is happening (day or night) before switching to closer shots with the subjects of the film. Film makers often use an establishing shot to let the audience know where the action is taking place.

### WATCH:
Check out the examples of establishing shots used in [Spiderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmF-PBPLlcA) and Wallace and Gromit. Notice how the first shots do not show the characters, but instead show the location and whether it is daytime or nighttime.

### CREATE:
Students will now take the rest of the project time to continue creating their movies. Students should add at least one establishing shot and finish taking at least 200 pictures.
