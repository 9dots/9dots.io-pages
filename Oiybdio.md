## Work Day

### DO NOW:
Students will have 3 minutes to write a description of the final scene of their movie.

### HOOK:
Watch some [stop motion inspiration](http://vimeo.com/1105462) to get the creativity flowing.

### EXPLAIN:
Today is the last day for students to take pictures for their stop motion projects. To make sure that their movie has a proper ending, students should plan and take pictures for their final scene before doing any other scenes.

### CREATE:
Students will begin taking pictures of their final scene. If they finish, they can continue to take pictures for other scenes. If a group feels that they have all of the pictures that they want, they can use the rest of the project time to begin editing their movies.
