## Setup

### Materials:

- Stop motion inspiration
- Computer with Photo Booth and iMovie (or other picture taking application)
- Editing checklist

### Preparation:
- Print editing checklist
    
## Work Day

### DO NOW:
Students will take 3 minutes to write down what they can be add to their movies using iMovie.

### DISCUSS:
_What were some of the examples of what editing can do to enhance your movie?_
In iMovie you can set the picture durations as well as add transitions, sound effects, background music, and titles.

_Why are sound effects important for a stop motion movie?_
Sound effects are particularly important for stop motion because there is no sound recorded while taking the pictures. This means that it can be a little boring to watch a stop motion without proper sound effects.

### GET CREATIVE:
Using the editing checklist as a guide, groups will take the rest of the project time to edit their videos using any transitions or sound effects within iMovie. Their movie should have at least 2 transitions, sound effects for action, and background music by the end of the project time.
