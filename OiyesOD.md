## Setup

### Materials:

- Stop motion inspiration
- Computer with Photo Booth and iMovie (or other picture taking application)
- Editing checklist

### Preparation:
- Print editing checklist
    
## Engage
Students take 3 minutes to write down what they can be add to their movies using iMovie.

## Explain 

1. _What were some of the examples of what editing can do to enhance your movie?_
	- In iMovie you can set the picture durations as well as add transitions, sound effects, background music, and titles.

2. _Why are sound effects important for a stop motion movie?_
	- Sound effects are particularly important for stop motion because there is no sound recorded while taking the pictures. This means that it can be a little boring to watch a stop motion without proper sound effects.

4. Give each group the [editing checklist handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OiyhygK.pdf).

## Elaborate
Using the editing checklist as a guide, groups take the rest of the project time to edit their videos using any transitions or sound effects within iMovie. Their movie should have at least 2 transitions, sound effects for action, and background music by the end of the project time.

## Evaluate
When all of the groups have completed the checklist, students go on a gallery walk and watch other videos around the room. Students write down their two favorite parts of the videos that they see.
