## Setup

### Materials:

- Computer with GarageBand software
- Happy and sad loops handout
- Happy (instrumental version)
- Say Something (instrumental version)

### Preparations:

- Download the songs (from the attachments area on the right)

## Introduce

### DO NOW:
Students will have a couple of minutes at the beginning of class to write down their answer to the question, “What makes a song seem happy?”

### HOOK:
Listen to the instrumental versions of Happy and Say Something without telling them the name of each song.

## Guided Practice

### DISCUSS:
How did the first song make you feel? How did the second song make you feel? What aspects of the songs do you think made them feel that way? Create a chart on a whiteboard with happy and sad categories.

### EXPLAIN:
There are several factors that can make a song happy or sad. A happy song has a beat that is fast (similar to a heart beat) and are often played in the major scale. A sad song tends to be slower, with less percussion, and is most often played in the minor scale. When you are selecting loops for your songs, you can choose to filter the loops shown to ones that are only in major or minor scale.

To filter the loops by major or minor scale change the option like in the picture below:

## Explore

### CREATE:
Using the rest of the class time, students will create two songs, that each have loops from at least three different instruments. One will be a song that makes that listener feel happy, and the other one will attempt to be a slower, sadder song.

### WRAP-UP:
How can you make a song seem sadder? What can you do to make it feel happier?
