## Setup

### Materials:

- Computer with GarageBand software

### Preparation:

- Download the example clip onto the computers

## Engage

1. Students take a couple of minutes to write down their question to, “What is your favorite music from a movie?”

2. _What does it mean to ‘score’ a movie?_
	- A film score is original music create to accompany a film. The music is composed for each scene to help set the mood.

## Explore
Show the film score example clips. After each example, discuss with the group how the music set the tone for the scene. 

## Explain
Show the example clip that the students are working with. First show it with no music, and then show it with the example music. All of the music in the example was made using the GarageBand loops that the students have been working with.

## Elaborate
Students have the rest of the project time to create their own score for the movie clip. If they finish early, students can add extra sound effects as well to the movie. To start, students need to open up GarageBand on the computer. 

- To creat a theme song:

	1. Open GarageBand

	2. Create a new ‘Movie’ project

	3. Enter a title for your project and press ‘Create’

	4. Click and drag the example click into the ‘Movie’ track

	5. Open the loops browser

	6. Click and drag loops into a new track that match the mood of the scene

	7. Click on the movie track to watch a preview of the clip with your original score

	8. Make sure to use the fade in and fade out to improve your score
