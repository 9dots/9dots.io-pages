## Engage

1. _What is a theme song?_
A theme song is music that is created to serve as an introduction into a movie, tv show, or radio program. It reflects the style and content of the show and sometimes even has lyrics to describe the situation.

2. As a group listen to a few famous theme songs. Discuss how each theme song relates to the movie that it is used for.

## Explain 

1. Each student needs a computer and the theme song checklist. During the project today, students create a theme song for their stop motion movies from the previous unit. Students write down the genre/mood of the their movie on the handout.

## Elaborate

1. Using the GarageBand loops, students produce a theme song that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The song should be at least one minute long and have at least 3 different instrument loops.

2. When they are finished students will share the song to iTunes using the **Share** menu at the top of the screen.
