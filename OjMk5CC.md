## Setup

### Materials:

- [History of video game controllers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-r9EH6R1k4)
- [Makey Makey video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU)
- Brainstorm worksheet

### Preparation:

- Print out the brainstorm worksheet (in the attachments section)

## Engage

1. _What is a video game controller?_
	- A game controller is a device used with a game or entertainment system to control what happens in the game. This means having the ability to move a character or respond to prompts.

2. Tell students that this unit is about creating GIANT cardboard video game controllers. Students are designing and creating these controllers themselves. But before they start designing, they need to learn about how their controllers work.

3. Show the students the [history of video game controllers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-r9EH6R1k4). Discuss after the video if they noticed any pattern about shape and the number of buttons that the controllers had as they evolved.

## Explain

1. _How do controllers work?_
	- Controllers work by sending a signal when a button is pressed. To make their own controllers, students will need to create buttons that will send a signal to the computer. Each group will get a Makey Makey to create working buttons.

2. Students watch the [Makey Makey video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU). Explain that the Makey Makey uses an electrical signal to know when different conductive materials are touched.

3. _What kind of controllers could you make using cardboard and the makey makey?_
	- Student may come up with many ideas for this but if they need help three good basic projects would be:
    
		- A giant controller that students will use with their hands
		- A giant controller that students will use with their feet

## Elaborate

1. Students split into groups for each kind of proposed controller.

2. Hand out the design brainstorm handout to each student. 
	- Each student develops a design for their proposed controller. 	- Remind students that at most they can use four buttons and four directions on their controller because of the Makey Makey.

3. With the other members of their group, students take their favorite ideas from each design and blend them into one final design for the group.

4. For any group that has a completed design, the next step is to list out the required materials for their project. Make sure they remember that they need to use conductive materials to make their buttons work.
