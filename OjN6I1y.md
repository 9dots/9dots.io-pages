## Work Day

### INTRODUCTION:
This is the last day for the giant game controller project. Students will test their buttons to make sure everything works, and the decorate the controller so that other people will want to use it.

### TESTING:
Students will test their buttons to make sure that every press sends a signal to the computer.  If the connection is bad and does not work every time, students should fix the controller by making sure that the aluminum foil can touch when the button is pressed.

### DECORATING:
To finish their project, teams will decorate their controller using any of the supplies around. They  can add instructions on how to use their controller as well as letters on the buttons.

### TRY IT OUT:
For the last 15 minutes of the project time, students will get to test their controller using games online.
