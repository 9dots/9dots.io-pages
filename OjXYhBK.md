## Engage - 10 minutes

1. _What are robots?_
	- A robot is a machine that resembles a human and does mechanical, routine tasks on command.

## Explain - 15 minutes

1. _What are robots useful for?_
	- Robots can help by doing things that humans don’t want to do.  These behaviors can be dangerous, boring, too hard, or even dealing with objects that are too heavy.

2. More examples of real robots in action. After each one, discuss what makes each robot useful (is this task boring? dangerous?).

## Elaborate - 15 minutes

1. As a class, students brainstorm:
	- What are things that I don’t like to do?
	- How could a robot help you do these things?

2. _If you could design any robot, what would it be?_
	- Students write a small description of their dream robot, using items brainstormed in guided research.
