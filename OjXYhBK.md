## Lesson:

### HOOK:
_What are robots?_
A robot is a machine that resembles a human and does mechanical, routine tasks on command.

### EXPLAIN:
Over the next 6 weeks in this unit, students will learn how to design and build their dream robot.

### INTRODUCE:
Watch a few videos of robots from movies and real life to help give students some ideas for their own robots.

### EXPLORE:
_What are robots useful for?_
Robots can help by doing things that humans don’t want to do.  These behaviors can be dangerous, boring, too hard, or even dealing with objects that are too heavy.

### WATCH:
More examples of real robots in action. After each one, discuss what makes each robot useful (is this task boring? dangerous?).

### GUIDED RESEARCH:
As a class, students brainstorm:

- What are things that I don’t like to do?
- How could a robot help you do these things?

### EXPLORE
_If you could design any robot, what would it be?_
Students will write a small description of your dream robot, using items brainstormed in guided research.
