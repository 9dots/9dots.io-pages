## Setup:

### Materials:

- [Blueprint handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjYBt73.pdf)
- Cardboard (for demonstration)
- MakeDo pieces (for demonstration)
- Markers
- Paper
- Projector

### Project Time:

- 35 min

## Engage

1. Watch the [Making of Iron Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O8Dhkt9VUo) video to show student an example of a cardboard robot. When it is finished discuss:
	- _How can you figure out how to build a robot like this iron man one?_
		- To build something complex, it is important to have detailed plans before we start building!

2. Students share their robot descriptions from the previous lessons with a partner. When they are finished, students make a drawing of what their own robot would look like.

3. Show students some [MakeDo Inspiration](https://mymakedo.com/blog/top-10-cardboard-robots). After, show the materials that students have available to them. What would their dream robot look like if it was made out the materials we have in the classroom?

## Explain

1. Today, to make sure it is possible to build their robot, students learn how to make a **blueprint**.

2. _What is a blueprint?_
	- A **blueprint** is a technical drawing that shows exactly how to build something.

3. While looking at following images, explain why **blueprints** need **dimensions** and **labels**.

	- http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Robotic_Little_Sisters?file=Blueprint_Little_Sister.jpg

4. _What are dimensions?_
	- **Dimensions** show the size of each piece of the blueprint.

5. _Why are the labels important?_
	- The **labels** make it so that each piece has a name and can be easily distinguished from other pieces.

## Elaborate
Students brainstorm how to turn their robot into a realistic design made out of cardboard, and sketch a blueprint of the robot using the blueprint worksheet.

## Evaluate:

- _Is your blueprint realistic?_ 
- _Will you be able to build it?_
