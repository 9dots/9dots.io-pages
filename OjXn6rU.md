## Lesson 

### HOOK:
Watch the [Making of Iron Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O8Dhkt9VUo) video to show student an example of a cardboard robot. When it is finished discuss:

_How do we figure out how to build a robot like this iron man one?_
We need detailed plans before we start building!

### SHARE:
Students will share their robot descriptions from the previous lessons with a partner. When they are finished, students  will make a drawing of what their own robot would look like.

### EXPLORE:
Show students some [MakeDo Inspiration](https://mymakedo.com/blog/top-10-cardboard-robots). After, show the materials that students will have available to them.

### DISCUSS:
What would your dream robot look like if it was made out the materials we have in the classroom?

### EXPLAIN:
Today, we are going to make a blueprint of our final robot.

_What is a blueprint?_
A blueprint is a technical drawing that shows exactly how to build something.

### EXAMPLES:
While looking at following images, explain how **blueprints** need **dimensions** and **labels**.
