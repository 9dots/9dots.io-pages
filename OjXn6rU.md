title: "Cardboard Robots: Blueprint"
objective: "By the end of the lesson, students will be able to define a blueprint, explain why dimensions and labels are important, and turn their sketches into realistic blueprints of their self-imagined robot."
org: 9dots
blurb: "Students will learn about the #MakeDo pieces they will be using to construct their robot, and create a detailed blueprint for their robot."

## Setup:

### Materials:

- Cardboard (for demonstration)
- MakeDo pieces (for demonstration)
- Markers
- Paper
- Projector

### Media and Handouts:

- Blueprint handout

### Project Time:

- 35 min

## Introduce

### HOOK:
Watch the [Making of Iron Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O8Dhkt9VUo) video to show student an example of a cardboard robot. When it is finished discuss:

_How can you figure out how to build a robot like this iron man one?_
To build something complex, it is important to have detailed plans before we start building!

### SHARE:
Students will share their robot descriptions from the previous lessons with a partner. When they are finished, students  will make a drawing of what their own robot would look like.

### EXPLORE:
Show students some [MakeDo Inspiration](https://mymakedo.com/blog/top-10-cardboard-robots). After, show the materials that students will have available to them. What would their dream robot look like if it was made out the materials we have in the classroom?

## Guided Practice

### EXPLAIN:
Today, to make sure it is possible to build their robot, students will learn how to make a **blueprint**.

_What is a blueprint?_
A **blueprint** is a technical drawing that shows exactly how to build something.

### EXAMPLES:
While looking at following images, explain why **blueprints** need **dimensions** and **labels**.

- http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Robotic_Little_Sisters?file=Blueprint_Little_Sister.jpg

_What are dimensions?_
**Dimensions** show the size of each piece of the blueprint.

_Why are the labels important?_
The **labels** make it so that each piece has a name and can be easily distinguished from other pieces.

## Explore

### BRAINSTORM:
Students will brainstorm how to turn their robot into a realistic design made out of cardboard, and sketch a blueprint of the robot using the blueprint worksheet.

### DISCUSS:

- _Is your blueprint realistic?_ 
- _Will you be able to build it?_
