title: "Cardboard Robots: Revision"
org: 9dots
blurb: "Students will learn about fixed and moving parts, use that information to revise their blueprints, and get hands-on experience with #MakeDo."
objective: "By the end of the lesson, student will be able to identify fixed parts of a robot, complete a feasibly blueprint for their robot, and construct basic cardboard structures using MakeDo pieces."

### Materials:

- Cardboard
- MakeDo pieces
- Other building supplies as available (ie straws, cups, paper bags, aluminum foil)
- Tape
- Markers
- Construction paper
- Projector

### Media and Handouts:
- [MakeDo paper robot video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-kaBIdoVm0)
- [Wall E clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oVSaUWeKt0)

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### HOOK:
Watch the [MakeDo paper robot video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-kaBIdoVm0) to show students some more examples of design posibilities.

### DISCUSS:
_What are the different parts of a robot?_

- Head
- Body
- Limbs

## Guided Practice

### EXPLAIN:
In a robot, their are parts that move, and parts that hold the robot up. The parts that support or resist loads in the robot are called **fixed** parts. The **moving** parts allow for constrained movement.

### WATCH AND EVALUATE:
As a class, brainstorm which parts are fixed and which parts are moving on Wall E (watch [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oVSaUWeKt0)).

### THINK PAIR SHARE:
For their own robots, students will write which parts will need to be fixed, and which will need to be moving. After, they will share with their partner what they have chosen and how they think they will be able to accomplish that.

## Explore

### REVISE BLUEPRINTS:
Today, students will be revising their plans to make sure that they are **feasible** and to label which parts will be **fixed** and which parts will be **moving**. Students should highlight the parts of their robot that will move. Students should then chose the base of their robot that they will start building today.

### MATERIALS:
Show the materials we have to work with (saw and connector only, no hinges) and show students how the MakeDo pieces work. After, students will practice sawing and connecting small practice pieces with the MakeDo.

### PLAN:
With the last 5 minutes of the lesson, students will look through the available boxes and their blue prints and decide which piece to build first.
