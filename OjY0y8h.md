title: "Cardboard Robots: Revision"
org: 9dots
blurb: "Students will learn about fixed and moving parts, use that information to revise their blueprints, and get hands-on experience with #MakeDo."
objective: 
  - Identify fixed parts of a robot
  - Complete a feasibly blueprint for their robot
  - Construct basic cardboard structures using MakeDo pieces

## Setup

### Materials:

- Cardboard
- MakeDo pieces
- Other building supplies as available (ie straws, cups, paper bags, aluminum foil)
- Tape
- Markers
- Construction paper
- Projector
- [MakeDo paper robot video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-kaBIdoVm0)
- [Wall E clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oVSaUWeKt0)

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage

1. Watch the [MakeDo paper robot video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-kaBIdoVm0) to show students some more examples of design posibilities.

2. _What are the different parts of a robot?_
	- Head
	- Body
	- Limbs

## Explain

1. In a robot, their are parts that move, and parts that hold the robot up. The parts that support or resist loads in the robot are called **fixed** parts. The **moving** parts allow for constrained movement.

2. As a class, brainstorm which parts are fixed and which parts are moving on Wall E (watch [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oVSaUWeKt0)).

3. For their own robots, students write which parts need to be fixed, and which need to be moving. After, they share with their partner what they have chosen and how they think they can accomplish that.

## Elaborate

1. Today, students are revising their plans to make sure that they are **feasible** and to label which parts must be **fixed** and which parts must be **moving**. Students highlight the parts of their robot that need to move. Students should then choose the base of their robot that the start building today.

2. Show the materials we have to work with (saw and connector only, no hinges) and show students how the MakeDo pieces work. After, students practice sawing and connecting small practice pieces with the MakeDo.

3. With the last 5 minutes of the lesson, students look through the available boxes and their blue prints and decide which piece to build first.
