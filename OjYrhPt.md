At the conclusion of the class, student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of hinges by constructing moveable limbs on their self-imagined robot.

## Materials

- Cardboard
- MakeDo pieces
- Tape

## Media and Handouts 

- N/A

## Project Time 

- 40 min

### Intro
•	Hook –  (5 min)
o	Who knows what a hinge is?
•	A hinge is a type of bearing that connects two solid objects, typically allowing only a limited angle of rotation between them
o	Where are the hinges in our body?

•	As a class, chart out things that are “Hinges in the body” and “Not hinges in the body” as well as “Hinges in the room” and “Not hinges in the room”
o	Today we are going to learn how to build hinges on our robots.
•	Intro – (5 min)
•	Discuss how hinges could they be useful for the robots we are designing?
•	Explore – (5 min)
o	Go back to students’ blueprints and highlight where all of the hinges will be in their designs
•	Guided research – (5 min)
o	Show students how the MakeDo hinges work
•	Reiterate –(20 min)
o	continue building cardboard robots by adding the moveable parts
