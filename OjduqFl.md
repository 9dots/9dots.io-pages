## Materials

- Cardboard
- [Copper tape](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10561)
- [LED lights](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12062)
- [Conductive paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-10ml/)
- [Batteries](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/338)
- [Battery holder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8822)

## Media and Handouts

- N/A

## Project Time

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Do Now:
Students will write down the components of a circuit on a a piece of paper.

### Hook:
Using all of the skills that they learned while making the cards in the previous lesson, students will get to add electronics on their own robots.

### Review:
On the same piece of paper, students will draw a diagram of a circuit. The diagram should denote the direction in which electricity is flowing, as well as include a power source, wires, a switch, and the light.

## Guided Practice

### Diagram:
On their blueprints, students will mark where they could incorportate one or two lights. Things to think about include:

- _Where would the battery go?_
- _What will the switch be made of?_

## Explore

### Plan:
On their robot, students will draw the circuit diagram in pencil. When they are finished with their design, the teach will have to approve it to make sure it is feasible.

### Build:
With their plans ready, students can start construction on their circuit. Remind students that the LED needs to be set up with the same polarity as the battery.
