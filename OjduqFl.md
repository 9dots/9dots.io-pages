## Setup

### Materials:

- Cardboard
- [Copper tape](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10561)
- [LED lights](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12062)
- [Conductive paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-10ml/)
- [Batteries](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/338)
- [Battery holder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8822)

### Media and Handouts:

- N/A

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage

1. Students write down the components of a circuit on a a piece of paper.

2. Using all of the skills that they learned while making the cards in the previous lesson, students get to add electronics on their own robots.

3. On the same piece of paper, students draw a diagram of a circuit. The diagram should denote the direction in which electricity is flowing, as well as include a power source, wires, a switch, and the light.

## Explain
On their blueprints, students mark where they could incorportate one or two lights. Things to think about include:

- _Where would the battery go?_
- _What will the switch be made of?_

## Elaborate

1. On their robot, students draw the circuit diagram in pencil. When they are finished with their design, the students get teacher approval to make sure it is feasible.

2. With their plans ready, students can start construction on their circuit. Remind students that the LED needs to be set up with the same polarity as the battery.
