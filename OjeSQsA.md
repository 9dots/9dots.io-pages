## Setup

### Materials:

- Decorations
- Cardboard
- Circuits

### Media and Handouts:

- N/A

### Project time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage

1. _What was the first thing that you did in this unit?_
	- The first thing that students did was to make a plan for their robot. This plan included a blueprint, as well as a building strategy.

2. Students vote on how close their final robot is to their original plans. They can vote that their robot is:

	1. Exactly like my plans
	2. Changed a little from my plans
	3. Not at all like my plans

## Explain

1. Students take 2 minutes to write down their initial idea for their robot as well as two ways that they can make their current robot more like their plan.

2. Students share with a partner the ideas that they have just written down about how to finish their robot.

## Elaborate
When students have finished planning, they work on building and decorating their robots.
