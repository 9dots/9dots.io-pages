### Hook:
Students will do a quick gallery walk around the room to see other robots, and come up with some ideas for their own as they finish up.

## Guided Practice

### Plan:
Students will make a list of additions that they can finish in one class period. 

### Think Pair Share:
Students will share with a partner the improvements that they will be making to their robot.

## Explore

### Building:
This will be the last building session for students. It is important to focus on improvements that can be finished in just one class period. Students should also make sure that their circuits are all working and have not been disconnected while they were working on other parts.

### Sharing:
With 5 minutes remaining in the lesson, students will each say their favorite part of their own design.
