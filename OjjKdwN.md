## Preparation

## Project Time

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Hook:
Today we are beginning our brand new unit of designing, creating and building our very own Interactive Art Wall!

### Discuss:
_What is a mural?_
Murals are more than just giant paintings. Students should think of murals not only as art projects, but as an interactive process that blends collaborative grouping, history, current events, local communities, social change, and leadership skills.

### Engage:
Some great things about murals include:

1.	Give students a voice and platform
2.	Bring people together
3.	Have a meaningful message/ optimisitc
4.	Build success and hope/ innovation
5.	Expand the concept of history and history makers.
6.	Strengthen ties between school and the community
7.	Allow students and teacher to learn and have fun!

## Guided Practice

### Explain:
_What does the word interactive mean?_
Something that is **interactive** is designed to respond to actions or command of a user.

### Watch:
To get started, watch a brief clip of the [MIT interactive art wall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9j8DIHXSKA)

### Discuss:

- _What makes this wall interative?_
- _What happens when she touches the wall?_
- _What is the subject of the mural?_

## Explore

### Explain:
Before we can begin adding all sorts of cool sensors on our wall we first need to come up with a theme and idea for our mural. As artists and innovators we are going to gather inspiration from other artists by looking at different murals.

### Analyze:
Distribute the Mural Review worksheet. Students will now get a chance to look at other murals and decide on what they like or dislike about each one.

### Show:
Using a projector, show students the first ten results on a google image search for murals. Students will take notes about each one on the handout.
