Discuss:

Murals are more than just giant paintings. Teachers should think of murals not only as art projects, but as an interactive process that blends collaborative grouping, history, current events, local communities, social change, and leadership skills.


Seven Great Things Murals 

1.	Give students a voice and platform
2.	Bring people together
3.	Have a meaningful message/ optimisitc
4.	Build success and hope/ innovation
5.	Expand the concept of history and history makers.
6.	Strengthen ties between school and the community
7.	Allow students and teacher to learn and have fun!


Today we are beginning our brand new unit of designing, creating and building our very own Interactive Art Wall!

This unit was inspired by Kristen and Josh’s trip to MIT this past summer. 

Before we jump into our unit, let’s talk about what does the word “interactive” mean?

Interactive: designed to respond to the actions, commands, etc., of a user





Engage:
To get us started we are going to watch a brief video clip of MIT interactive art wall.

Discuss:

What makes this wall interactive?
What happens when she touches the wall?
What is the mural of?

Before we can begin adding all sorts of cool sensors on our wall we first need to come up with a theme and idea for our mural. As artists and innovators we are going to gather inspiration from other artists by looking at different murals.
