## Setup

### Materials:

- [Sketch handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjjqjZ8.pdf)
- [Community handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjjqhF0.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Print the [Sketch handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjjqjZ8.pdf)
- Print the [Community handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjjqhF0.pdf)

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Congratulate students for doing a great job on the first day reviewing the different murals and thinking about what they like and didn't like.

2. Today, students develop ideas to contribute to a collaborative mural. The ideas that they come up with should adhere to a common theme.

## Explore - 5 minutes
Students take three minutes to write down possible themes for the group mural. 

## Explain - 10 minutes

1. After you have brainstormed what each idea would look like and consist of. Transition into discussing what would make the best mural idea. 
	- Which idea or combination of ideas would be the most interesting?
	- What would be not too easy but not too hard?
	- Which idea would give us a lot of options for everyone to participate in?

2. The theme for the mural will be 'Our Community!' This way, students are be able to include a lot of different ideas of people, places, and things that are important to everyone.

## Elaborate - 20 minutes

1. Using the community handout, students write notes about their community:
	- What are the landmarks?
	- What places do you go to regularly?
	- What buildings do you recognize?
	- What places are important to you?

2. Students will sketch out an idea for their part of the mural. When they are finished, tape all of the sketches to the wall to see what the collaborative mural would look like.
