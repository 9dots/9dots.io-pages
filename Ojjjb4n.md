## Introduce

### Hook:
Congratulate students for doing a great job on the first day reviewing the different murals and thinking about what they like and didn't like.

### Goal:
Today, students will develop ideas to contribute to a collaborative mural. The ideas that they come up with should adhere to a common theme.

## Guided Practice

### Theme:
The theme for the mural will be 'Our Community!' This way, students will be able to include a lot of different ideas of people, places, and things that are important to everyone.

### Brainstorm:
For the local community consider the following:

- What are the landmarks?
- What places do you go to regularly?
- What buildings do you recognize?
- What places are important to you?

## Explore


After you have brainstormed what each idea would look like and consist of. Transition into discussing what would make the best mural idea. 

- Which idea or combination of ideas would be the most interesting?
- What would be not too easy but not too hard?
- Which idea would give us a lot of options for everyone to participate in?
