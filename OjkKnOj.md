blurb: Students learn about electronic sensor and how they can be added to their mural to make them interactive.  This is an exploration driven lesson which culminates with students testing combinations of littleBits to discover how they work.
objective: 
  - Define a power source
  - Identify a sensor
  - Describe how to connect the Little Bits to create a circuit

## Setup

### Materials:

- [Little Bits](http://littlebits.cc)
- [Little Bits worksheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjkT9Sg.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Draw an example of a power source, sensor, output. An example could be a battery, touch sensors, light.

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Get students thinking about sensors by relating it to the senses that humans have.

1. Today, students learn about electronic sensors that can make their mural interactive. 

2. Ask students, "_What are the senses that the human body has?_"
  - Sight
  - Touch
  - Taste
  - Sound
  - Smell

3. Discuss, "_What are the senses in the body used for?_"
  - The senses are used to respond to the outside environment, such as:
    - if we feel something is too hot, we move our hand away
    - it we see candy we want to have, we grab it
    - if we hear our dog running away, we call their name
    - if we taste something bad, we spit it out

## Explain - 15 minutes
During this explain, teach students how sensors work and give some real life examples of sensors. Then, introduce littleBits and show a video to demonstrate how they work.

1. Just like with the body, in electronic senses are called “sensors”.  

2. A sensor is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. 

3. A sensor is used to measure a physical quantity such as temperature, pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g a voltage).

4. Some examples of sensors from real life include:
  - Fire alarm – sense smoke in the air and turn on noise
  - Light switch – sense motion and turn on light
  - Clap on clap off lights – sense sound and turn on light

5. To use a sensor, there are components students need to understand:
  1. Power - Supplies electricity, such as a battery
  2. Sensor - Checks for a condition to be met
  3. Output - Action, such as a light or buzzer

6. The **sensors** are like a gate: they allow or disallow current to flow through the circuit to the output.  The electricity can only flow through to power the output if the sensor senses what it is looking for. 

7. Students put power, sensors, and outputs into our interactive mural!  To accomplish this, they are using something called littleBits.

8. Watch littleBits video:

9. Hand out the Little Bits worksheet.  Go through an example of the worksheet with students, choosing an input and output, and filling out the fields on the board while students test it and write on their handout.

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
This time will be dedicated to students testing out different combinations of littleBits on their paper and writing down the results on the [handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjkT9Sg.pdf).

1. Using the worksheet, students should choose new input and output combinations and test them. Students record the results on the worksheet.

2. If there is extra time, have computers on hand for students to peruse the [Little Bits](http://littlebits.cc) website.
