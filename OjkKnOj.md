Lesson 3 – Little Bits

ON THE BOARD
Image of power (battery), sensor (thermometer) with arrow to output (lightbulb)

(5 MIN) 
Today we are going to learn about electronic sensors.  We will be using sensors to help us to make our mural interactive. 

I am guessing you all know about the senses our bodies have.  What are the senses our body has?
•	Sight
•	Touch
•	Taste
•	Sound

What are the senses in our body used for?
•	To respond to the outside environment
o	if we feel something is too hot, we move our hand away
o	it we see candy we want to have, we grab it
o	if we hear our dog running away, we call their name
o	if we taste something bad, we spit it out

(5 MIN)
Just like with the body, in electronic senses are called “sensors”.   A sensor is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. A sensor is used to measure a physical quantity such as temperature, pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g a voltage).

•	Examples of sensors from real life
o	Fire alarm – sense smoke in the air and turn on noise
o	light switch – sense motion and turn on light
o	clap on clap off lights – sense sound and turn on light

(5 MIN)
How to sensors work?

•	Power ie battery
•	Sensor ie sound, motion, button
•	Output ie buzzer, light

The sensors are like a gate: they allow or disallow current to flow through the circuit to the output.  The electricity can only flow through to power the output if the sensor senses what it is looking for.  give concrete example of pressing a button and turing on a light.

(10 MIN)
We are going to be able to put power, sensors, and outputs into our interactive mural!  We are going to do this using something called Little Bits.

Watch little bits video:  

http://littlebits.cc/about

Pause video for students to identify power sensor output.

Hand out the Little Bits worksheet.  Go through an example of the worksheet with students, choosing an input and output, and filling out the fields on the board.  

Guided practice: Choose new input and output for everyone to do together on the sheet.  Have students name most of the things for this one.

(15 MIN)
Student go through worksheet.


If extra time, have computers on hand for students to peruse little bits website.
