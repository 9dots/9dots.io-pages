Lesson 4 - Learning how to build with little bits

ON THE BOARD:

(5 MIN)
start by showing this video:  http://littlebits.cc/projects/rude-animal

Once you have figured out how to connect the power, sensors, and outputs of the Little Bits, that’s just half of the challenge.  Connecting the to what you are building is very important.

Show example little bits creature that I made and talk about how I went about hiding the bits inside of the creature.  

We have twist ties to help attach little bits to what we are building without damaging the little bits.

We can also start using wires so that we can have the different pieces where we want them.

Today we are going to practice building with little bits by making a little bits creature.  Show examples of little bits creatures on the little bits website:

You will need to be creative in order to hide the Little Bits pieces.

Build little bits creatures.

•	Show supplies we have to work with
o	Tp roll
o	Pre-made ears, hands, heads
o	Little bits
o	Markers
o	Twist ties

Pass out one tp roll to each student. Have students come one at a time to choose the bits they are going to use.  Limit them to one output, one input.
