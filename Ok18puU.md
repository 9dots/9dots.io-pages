blurb: "Students revisit their initial sketches for their mural to plan for creating a foreground and background. This lesson starts by discussing the plans for creating a collaborative mural. Then, students use a list of littleBits and the brainstorming handout to choose which littleBits to incorporate. After, teach students about foreground and background and how to hide littleBits behind an elevated foreground. Students demonstrate learning by creating a plan for their foreground and background with littleBits."
objective: 
  - Explain the difference between background and foreground
  - Use those concepts to plan their mural to be three dimensional

## Setup

### Materials:

- Pencils
- [littleBits overview](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1J6w8.pdf)
- [littleBits brainstorming handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1Ihug.pdf)
- [Foreground and Background handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1IjtI.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Write the definitions of foregroud and background on the whiteboard
- Pass out mural sketches to students

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes



## Explain - 15 minutes
Teach students about foreground and background and plan for which littleBits that they need for their mural.

1. Today, students start working on their murals.  Each student builds their own piece of the mural, and then when each of the individual murals are finished the murals are layered together to create the group mural.

1. Now that students know about Little Bits, they should look back at their sketch and think about what inputs and outputs they will use.  
	1. Distribute the [littleBits overview handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1J6w8.pdf) and the [littleBits brainstorming handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1Ihug.pdf).
    2. Students browse through the littleBits overview handout to decide which they will use for their mural.
    3. Students fill out the littleBits brainstorming handout.
    4. Make sure students mark on their sketch where the input, output and power would go.

2. Students sign up for use of Little Bits alphabetically.

3. Ask students what they know about foreground and then explain.
	- The **foreground** is what looks like the closest thing to you. It's in front of everything else in the picture, and it has the most detail.  It will also be the piece that hides Little Bits pieces for the mural.

4. Discuss how foreground is related to background.
	- The **background** is the opposite-- it's the farthest away and has the least detail. 

## Elaborate - 20 minutes

1. Students need to think about what their background and foreground will be.  They should remember that in their case, the Little Bits will be hiding behind the items in the foreground.

2. Students discuss their plans for a foreground and background with a partner.

3. Students complete the background and foreground handout. When they are finished, they have a strong plan for how to create their mural.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

1. What is foreground?
	- The **foreground** is what looks like the closest thing to you. It's in front of everything else in the picture, and it has the most detail.  It will also be the piece that hides Little Bits pieces for the mural.
    
2. Why will the foreground and background be on separate pieces of cardboard for this project?
	- They will be separated so that the foreground can hide the litteBits being used.
