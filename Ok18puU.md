## Lesson Overview


## Setup

### Materials:

- Pencils
- [Little Bits overview](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1J6w8.pdf)
- [Little Bits brainstorming handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1Ihug.pdf)
- [Foreground and Background handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1IjtI.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Write the definitions of foregroud and background on the whiteboard
- Pass out mural sketches to students

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage
Today, students start working on their murals.  Each student builds their own piece of the mural, and then the murals are layered together to create the group mural.

## Explain

1. Now that students know about Little Bits, they should look back at their sketch and think about what inputs and outputs they will use.  
  - Browse through the handout with all of the little bits
  - Fill out the brainstorming little bits handout
  - Make sure students mark on their sketch where the input, output and power would go

2. Students sign up for use of Little Bits alphabetically.

3. _What is foreground?_
	- The **foreground** is what looks like the closest thing to you. It's in front of everything else in the picture, and it has the most detail.  It will also be the piece that hides Little Bits pieces for the mural.

4. _What is background?_
	- The **background** is the opposite-- it's the farthest away and has the least detail. 

## Elaborate

1. Students need to think about what their background and foreground will be.  They should remember that in their case, the Little Bits will be hiding behind the items in the foreground.

2. Students discuss their plans for a foreground and background with a partner.

2. Students complete the background and foreground handout. When they are finished, they have a strong plan for how to create their mural.
