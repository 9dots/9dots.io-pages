## Materials

- Pencils

## Media and Handouts

- Little Bits overview
- Little Bits brainstorming handout
- Foreground and Background handout

## Preparation

- Write the definitions of foregroud and background on the whiteboard
- Pass out mural sketches to students

## Project Time

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Hook:
Today, students will start working on their murals.  Each student will be building their own piece of the mural, and then they will be layered together to create the group mural.

## Guided Practice

### Planning:
Now that students know about Little Bits, they will look back at their sketch and think about what inputs and outputs they would like to use.  

- Browse through the handout with all of the little bits
- Fill out the brainstorming little bits handout
- Make sure students mark on their sketch where the input, output and power would go

### Sign Up:
Students will sign up for use of Little Bits alphabetically.

### Foreground and Background:
Show the example and have students notice that it is 3D.  The sketch has a background and a foreground.

_What is foreground?_
The **foreground** is what looks like the closest thing to you. It's in front of everything else in the picture, and it has the most detail.  It will also be the piece that hides Little Bits pieces for the mural.

_What is background?_
The **background** is the opposite-- it's the farthest away and has the least detail. 

## Explore

### Think Pair Share: 
Students need to think about what their background and foreground will be.  They should remember that in their case, the Little Bits would be hiding behind the items in the foreground. Students will discuss their ideas with a partner.

### Written:
Students will complete the background and foreground handout. When they are finished, they will have a strong plan for how to create their mural.
