## Setup

### Materials:

- Animal names to draw
- [Biomimicry worksheet](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1Vq4z.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Print worksheets

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage

1. Watch clip from the show [Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va_YvHaewOc). Briefly explain the show to the students.

2. Today, students are starting a brand new unit in which they are designing their own products.  At the end, they will present their products to judges, just like the show Shark Tank, and the judges will choose which product they think should win.

## Explain

1. _What is a product?_
	- A **product** is something that is sold to people to satisfy a need or a want.

2. _What are ways that people can get ideas for designing new products?_
	- Brainstorm idea on the board.

3. For this unit, student are getting ideas from nature.  Using examples from nature to solve human problems is called **biomimicry**.

4. After showing examples, have students brainstorm examples of biomimicry that they can think of from real life.

5. The goal for this unit is to think of a product that does not exist that is inspired by a certain animal.  Students then make a poster and pitch their product to the judges.

6. Snails have a shell that their whole body can fit inside to protect them.  Maybe this would inspire be to develop a helmet that can expand to protect a personâ€™s entire body rather than just their head.

## Elaborate

1. Assign students partners. Once they have formed their group, students choose an animal from a hat.

2. Students read the worksheet on their animal. When they have finished, they fill out the worksheet, highlighting three things about the animal that could be interesting to inspire a product.

## Evaluate
Each group shares the three interesting facts that they found about their animal with the group.
