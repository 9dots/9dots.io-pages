## Materials

## Media and Handouts

- Worksheet

## Preparation

- Print worksheets

## Project Time

## Introduce

### Hook:
_Do you think that engineers always design their products exactly how they want them on the first try? How long do you think it takes to design a product?_

### Guess:
Give each student three index card to write their guess for how long it took to design the following products:

- a new car model
- iPhone
- Velcro

### Reveal:
The answer are:

- new car model - 3 years
- iPhone - 5 years
- Velcro - 10 years

## Guided Practice

### Discuss:
_Why does the design proces take so long?_
There are a lot of steps to designing a product. It is important to go through a lot of iterations (versions) and continue to make changes to design the best product possible.

### Explain:
Today, students will brainstorm products that are inspired by the animals that they chose last time in class.  They will then begin to refine their designs so we make the best product possible.

## Explore

### Written:
Go through packet one page at a time as a group.  Explain each page and then have kids fill it out.

As we reach new vocab words, define words as a class.

**Prototype:**  an early version of a product design, meant to be replicated or learned from

**Iterate:** to repeat

**Elaborate:**  develop details
