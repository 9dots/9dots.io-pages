blurb: "Students take a more in-depth look at the process behind designing a product. They will then apply that methodology to their own products. Students demonstrate learning by sharing their design ideas with the class."
objective: 
  - Define prototype
  - Explain the process of design
  - Discuss the importance of iteration to that process

## Setup

### Materials:

- Pencils
- Index cards
- [Product design guide](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ok1xt7f.pdf)

### Preparation:

- Print worksheets

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Start by asking students questions about product design.
	- _Do you think that engineers always design their products exactly how they want them on the first try?_ 
    - _How long do you think it takes to design a product?_

2. Give each student three index card to write their guess for how long it took to design the following products:
	- a new car model
    - iPhone
    - Velcro

3. The answer are:
	- new car model - 3 years
	- iPhone - 5 years
	- Velcro - 10 years

## Explain - 5 minutes

1. _Why does the design proces take so long?_
	- There are a lot of steps to designing a product. It is important to go through a lot of iterations (versions) and continue to make changes to design the best product possible.

2. Today, students are brainstorming products that are inspired by the animals that they chose last time in class.  After choosing an idea, students begin to refine their designs so they can make the best product possible.

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
Go through packet one page at a time as a group.  Explain each page, and then have kids fill it out. As the group reaches new vocab words, define the words as a class.

- **Prototype:**  an early version of a product design, meant to be replicated or learned from

- **Iterate:** To repeat

- **Elaborate:**  To develop details

## Evaluate - 10 minutes
Students demonstrate learning by sharing their refined design ideas with the class.
