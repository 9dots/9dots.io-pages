On the board:  vocab from worksheet



 


How long do you think it takes to design a product?

Give each kid 3 index cards to write their guess for the following:

How long do you think it takes to design a new car model?  3 years
iphone?  5 years
Velcro? 10 years

Discuss why the design process takes so long.  

Encourage students to take their time exploring iterations and making changes to their designs to make them the best they can be.


Discuss:  Today we are going to brainstorm products that are inspired by the animals that we chose last time in class.  We are then going to refine our designs so we make the best product possible.

Engage:

Go through packet one page at a time as a group.  Explain each page and then have kids fill it out.

As we reach new vocab words, define words as a class.

•	Prototype:  an early version of a product design, meant to be replicated or learned from

•	Iterate: to repeat

•	Elaborate:  develop details
