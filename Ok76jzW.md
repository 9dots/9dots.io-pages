## Lesson Overview
In this final lesson, students present their product presentations to a panel of judges. The judges use a rubric for scoring the presentations in which students are judged on their product, visual aide, and ability to present their product.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Posters
- Judging rubric

### Preparations:

- Print out rubric and find a place to hang posters during presentations

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Presentation Day - 40 minutes
Student groups take turns presenting their products to the judges panel. Each group should use their visual aides (poster and product) to help their presentation.

1. Today, students present their products to the judges. They should use their posters as visual aides, and attempt to convice the judges to invest in their product. 
	- After each presentation, everyone in the class will snap their fingers to applaud their fellow shark tank contestant. 
 
2. Judges use the rubric to score the presentations.
    
3. When everyone has finished, judges tally up the scores, and the Shark Tank winner is announced.
