blurb: "For the last day of this unit, students polish previous levels and add a new level that features some additional mechanics. When they have finished, students review games created by their peers and take notes on how the levels adhere to level design principles."
objective: 
  - Demonstrate understanding of mechanics by adding moving blocks and a door that requires the player to get a key to pass
  - Design a level that incorporates both new features

## Setup

### Materials:

- Computers with internet access
- Handout

### Project Time:
45 minutes

## Introduce - 10 minutes

1. So far the game has a limited set of mechanics. Ask the students, “What are the mechanics of the levels that you have created so far?”

2. Some examples of mechanics are holding jump for longer makes the character jump higher and the flag marks the end of the level.

3. Today, students are adding two new mechanics to the game.

4. The first mechanic is adding a door the blocks the players path.
	- The door requires a key to open
	- Make the key visible but not on the same path as the door
	- Make sure the player can not just jump over the door
	- To make the door work you need to pick the correct corresponding key item

5. The second mechanic that students are adding is moving blocks.
Moving blocks can be a fun way to challenge players to move over a gap
	1. To create a moving block start by creating a gap that is too big for the player to jump across.

	2. Add a block that start near the right side of the gap.
    3. Right click on the block to reveal the menu. 
    	- Click on the ‘Convert to moving tile...’ option

	4. Click on the endpoint the block should float to.

## Define - 5 minutes
What are the problems that you as a designer are trying to teach the player how to solve?

- Players can not get past the door without a key
- The player needs to use the moving block to make it across a long gap


## Ideate - 10 minutes
On the handout, students draw a concept for a level that incorporates both new mechanics into the same level.

## Prototype - 15 minutes
Students create their levels on gamefroot and use the script from the third lesson to link this level to the previous ones.

## Test - 5 minutes

1. Students test their game by pressing the play button. 

2. Once the game is finished, students find a partner to review each other's games.

3. As students play the game, use space on the handout to assess how the levels show the principles of game design that they have learned.
