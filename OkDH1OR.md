- Hot glue
- Twist ties

- N/A

### Preparations:

- Glue the cutouts together to make stacks of cardboard

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Work Day

### Little Bits:
Students should use their plans from the foreground and background lesson to help determine where their Little Bits should go.  If they are using a motor, students will need to cut a whole in their background and tape the motor in to place. After, they will attach their foreground to the motor using the twist ties.

### Layering:
Show students the stacks of cardboard that are glued together. To help give their mural a 3D feel, and to make sure there is room to hide the Little Bits, students will use these stacks of cardboard to create separation between the foreground and background. When students have figure out where they want to attach their foreground, an instructor will help attach it using the hot glue gun.
