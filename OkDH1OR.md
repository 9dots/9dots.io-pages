## Setup

### Materials:

- Cardboard
- littleBits
- Hot glue gun
- Hot glue
- Twist ties

### Preparations:

- Cut out small (2" x 2") pieces of cardboard
- Glue the cutouts together to make stacks of cardboard

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Step 1 - Layering

1. Students cut their foreground into a shape that works with the Little Bits. 

2. Show students the stacks of cardboard that are glued together.
	- To help give their mural a 3D feel, and to make sure there is room to hide the Little Bits, students use these stacks of cardboard to create separation between the foreground and background. 
    
3. When students have figure out where they want to attach their foreground, an instructor will help attach it using the hot glue gun.

## Step 2 - Adding littleBits

1. Students should use their plans from the [foreground and background lesson](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/Ok18puU) to help determine where their littleBits should go. 

2. If they are using a motor, students need to cut a whole in their background and tape the motor in to place. After, they attach their foreground to the motor using the twist ties.

3. Students attach their littleBits and turn them on and test their interactive mural.

4. When all of the murals are completed, use a peg board to connect all of the paintings together to make one large interactive mural.
