## Lesson Overview
Students learn about the forces that act on falling objects and create a device to protect an egg falling. Engage students by showing them a video of Felix Baumgartner's jump from the stratosphere. Then, show the students their building materials and have them design a device for protecting their eggs. Nextm explain the forces that act on a falling object. Students demonstrate learning by creating a contraption that keeps the egg from cracking.

## Setup
### Materials (per group):

- 1 raw egg
- 10 regular drinking straws
- 2 meters string
- 1 paper lunch bag
- 4 cotton balls
- 1 plastic shopping bag
- 4 paper clips
- 2 sheets of 8.5x11" paper
- masking tape

### Preparations:

- Set up a drop area with newspaper or trash bags to make it easily cleaned
- Print the [egg drop handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OokKUyc.docx)
- Set up projector with the [egg drop powerpoint]()

### Project Time:

- 55 minutes

## Engage - 10 minutes
Get students excited about the project by watching the video of Felix Baumgartner jumping from the stratosphere.

1. Watch the video of Felix Baumgartner stratosphere jump from the powerpoint.

2. Ask a series of questions to get students thinking about parachutes
	- Why did Felix need a parachute? 
    - What else are parachutes used for? 
    - What would happen if we didn’t use parachutes for those instances?

3. Today students are designing, building, and testing contraptions that can hold and protect an egg when dropped from different heights! 

4. Each group is going to be given the same amount of time and materials so its important to think about your science and engineering knowledge to design the most durable “egg-chute” possible!

## Explore - 5 minutes
Students learn more about their objectives and design their contraption on paper.

1. What design will allow for the egg to survive when dropped from various heights?
	- Egg must be visible (even if only very slightly).
	- There is a strict ‘no yolk’ policy (a crack is okay, but yolk will be disqualified).

2. Show students the materials that they are allowed to use to create their vehicle.

3. Students draw their designs on the egg drop handout.

## Explain - 10 minutes
With the powerpoint to guide the discussion, teach students about the forces that act on the egg as it is dropped.

1. **Gravitational Potential Energy**: The energy stored in an object as a result of its vertical position, or height.
	- G.P.E. = mass * gravity * height
    	- This means that each student's project's mass will be the deciding factor for the overall initial amount of G.P.E. 

2. **Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.
	- Energy is transformed from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. Ask students where energy transformations are occurring as the egg parachute is released and falls.

3. **Gravity** The attraction between any two objects, in this case the Earth and the egg parachute; a non-contact force.
	- This is Newton's 2nd Law, which states force is the relationship between mass and acceleration (F=ma). Ask students what is the variable that ranges from project to project, and how that variable affects the force pulling their parachutes down.

4. **Air resistance** Also known as drag, this is the force opposing the free fall through the air by the fluid or gas particles.
	- Ask students if all the parachutes will fall at exactly the same speed, considering gravity does not change. Ask why or why not?
    - Encourage students to consider the amount of contact between their parachute and the air surrounding it and how that will affect the rate at which their parachute falls when they design their project. 

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
Open discussion to hear/provide tips after 15 minutes of building

Tips to help guide building:

1. Review air resistance with 2 cold calls to remind students that the air resistance will slow down the egg.

2. Distribution of force of impact. The larger the area of impact, the less likely the egg will break. (push down on egg with pen vs. palm of hand; more area to absorb energy)

## Evaluate - 10 minutes
To test the designs, drop their contraptions from 2 meters, 4 meters, 6 meters, 8 meters.

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| MS-PS2-2      | Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object | Explain |
| MS-PS3-5      | Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object |   Explore |
| MS-ETS1-2 	| Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the chance in an object’s motion depends on the sum of forces on the object and the mass of the object   |   Explore |
