## Setup
Materials (per group)
•1 raw egg
•10 regular drinking straws
•2 meters string
•1 paper lunch bag
•4 cotton balls
•1 plastic shopping bag
•4 paper clips
•2 sheets of 8.5x11" paper
•masking tape

## Engage
Video of Felix Baumgartner stratosphere jump

Ask, _why did Felix need a parachute? What else are parachutes used for? What would happen if we didn’t use parachutes for those instances?_

Say, _today we are going to design, build, and test contraptions that can hold and protect an egg when dropped from different heights! Each group is going to be given the same amount of time and materials so its important to think about your science and engineering knowledge to design the most durable “egg-chute” possible!_
## Explore
Question: What design will allow for the egg to survive when dropped from various heights?

10 minutes to design their device on paper
30 minutes to build and test*
10 minutes for final drops (declare best design)

*Project may only include provided materials

Egg must be visible (even if only very slightly)

Strict ‘no yolk’ policy (a crack is okay, but yolk will be disqualified)

## Explain
**Gravitational Potential Energy**: The energy stored in an object as a result of its vertical position, or height.

- Application: G.P.E.=m*g*h. This means that each student's project's mass will be the deciding factor for the overall initial amount of G.P.E. 

**Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.

- Application: Energy is transformed from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. Ask students where energy transformations are occurring as the egg parachute is released and falls.

**Gravity** The attraction between any two objects, in this case the Earth and the egg parachute; a non-contact force

- Application: This is Newton's 2nd Law, which states force is the relationship between mass and acceleration (F=ma). Ask students what is the variable that ranges from project to project, and how that variable affects the force pulling their parachutes down.

**Air resistance** Also known as drag, this is the force opposing the free fall through the air by the fluid or gas particles.

- Application: Ask students if all the parachutes will fall at exactly the same speed, considering gravity does not change. Ask why or why not? Encourage students to consider the amount of contact between their parachute and the air surrounding it and how that will affect the rate at which their parachute falls when they design their project. 

## Elaborate
Open discussion to hear/provide tips after 15 minutes of building

Tips:

More air resistance (Quickly review air resistance with 2 cold calls)

Distribution of force of impact (push down on egg with pen vs. palm of hand; more area to absorb energy)

## Evaluate
Time for testing!

Drop from 2 meters, 4 meters, 6 meters, 8 meters

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| MS-PS2-2      | Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object | Explain |
| MS-PS3-5      | Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object |   Explore |
| MS-ETS1-2 	| Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the chance in an object’s motion depends on the sum of forces on the object and the mass of the object   |   Explore |
