title: Egg Drop
blurb: Keep an egg safe when dropped from the second floor
org: 9dots
objective: SWBAT design and construct a device to prevent an egg from cracking when dropped from various heights
id: "9dots-Oo3uuog"

## Setup
Materials (per group)
•1 raw egg
•10 regular drinking straws
•2 meters string
•1 paper lunch bag
•4 cotton balls
•1 plastic shopping bag
•4 paper clips
•2 sheets of 8.5x11" paper
•masking tape

## Engage
Video of Felix Baumgartner stratosphere jump

Ask, why did Felix need a parachute? What else are parachutes used for? What would happen if we didn’t use parachutes for those instances?

Say, today we are going to design, build, and test contraptions that can hold and protect an egg when dropped from different heights! Each group is going to be given the same amount of time and materials so its important to think about your science and engineering knowledge to design the most durable “egg-chute” possible!
## Explore
Question: What design will allow for the egg to survive when dropped from various heights?

10 minutes to design their device on paper
30 minutes to build and test*
10 minutes for final drops (declare best design)

*Project may only include provided materials

Egg must be visible (even if only very slightly)

Strict ‘no yolk’ policy (a crack is okay, but yolk will be disqualified)

## Explain
Energy (gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy)
Forces (heavier and faster yields higher force)
Newton’s 2nd Law (F=ma heavier and faster means more force)

## Elaborate
Open discussion to hear/provide tips after 15 minutes of building

Tips:

More air resistance (what is air resistance?)

Distribution of force of impact (push down on egg with pen vs. palm of hand more area to absorb energy)

## Evaluate
Time for testing!

Drop from 2 meters, 4 meters, 6 meters, 8 meters,
