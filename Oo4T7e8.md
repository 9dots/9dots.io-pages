## Lesson Overview
Students learn about gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy and create a roller coaster for a marble. This lesson starts by showing a video of a roller coaster and discussing energy. Next, students learn about potential energy and kinetic energy and their relationship. Students demonstrate learning by creating a marble roller coaster that successfully transports the marble to the bottom of the track.

## Setup
### Materials:

- Cardstock paper
- Masking tape
- Scissors
- Marbles

### Preparation:

- Cut cardstock paper into ~1.5" wide strips
- Set up projector with the [roller coaster powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ou0ZFvr.pptx)

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Get students thinking about energy by showing them the video of a roller coaster in action in the powerpoint.

1. Watch the [roller coaster video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dC6uJDNf64).

2. Ask, _what types of energy are present in this video? At what points on the roller coaster did you see these types of energy?_

## Explore - 5 minutes
Students design and test out various methods of constructing the track and base of the roller coaster.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Using the powerpoint as a guide, teach students about the relationship between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.

1. **Gravitational Potential Energy (G.P.E.)**: The energy stored in an object as a result of its vertical position, or height.

2. `G.P.E. = mass * gravity * height` 
	- This means that the taller the roller coaster, the more G.P.E. the marble will have, as the marble mass and the gravitational force are constants. 

3. **Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.
	- Energy is transformed from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy and back to gravitational potential energy. Ask students where the energy conversions occur.

5. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transformed from one form to another

6. The marble can never be able to exceed the height of the starting point of the roller coaster (implement this concept in the design of the roller coaster).

7. To build the roller coaster:
	1. Fold the strips of paper in half
    2. Connect 8 strips using tape to create a cube
    3. Stack 2-3 cubes on top of each other to make the coaster taller
    4. Add the track by taping folded strips of paper to the cube frame

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
Students combine their tracks and their base to produce a structure that has the greatest gravitational potential energy.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test the designs for safety, design, and innovation by setting a marble down at the top of the roller coaster.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| MS-PS2-2      | Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object | Explore |
| MS-PS3-2      | Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different amounts of potential energy are stored in the system |   Explore, Explain |
| MS-PS3-5      | Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object |   Explore, Explain |
| MS-ETS1-2 	| Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the chance in an object’s motion depends on the sum of forces on the object and the mass of the object   |   Explore |
