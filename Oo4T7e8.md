---

## Setup
**Materials** 
•Cardstock paper
•Masking tape
•Scissors
•Marbles
**Preparation** 
•Cut cardstock paper into ~1.5" wide strips

## Engage
Watch roller coaster video
Ask, _what types of energy are present in this video? At what points on the roller coaster did you see these types of energy?_

## Explore
Students design and test out various methods of constructing the track and base of the roller coaster

## Explain
Gravitational potential energy
Kinetic energy
Law of conservation of energy

## Elaborate
Students combine their tracks and their base to produce a structure that has the greatest gravitational potential energy 

## Evaluate
Test the designs for safety, design, and innovation
