## Setup
**Materials** 
•Cardstock paper
•Masking tape
•Scissors
•Marbles
**Preparation** 
•Cut cardstock paper into ~1.5" wide strips

## Engage
Watch roller coaster video
Ask, _what types of energy are present in this video? At what points on the roller coaster did you see these types of energy?_

## Explore
Students design and test out various methods of constructing the track and base of the roller coaster

## Explain
**Gravitational Potential Energy**: The energy stored in an object as a result of its vertical position, or height.

- Application: G.P.E.=m*g*h. This means that the taller the roller coaster, the more G.P.E. the marble will have, as the marble mass and the gravitational force are constants. 

**Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.

- Application: Energy is transformed from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy and back to gravitational potential energy. Ask students where the energy conversions occur.

**Law of conservation of energy**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transformed from one form to another

- Application: The marble will never be able to exceed the height of the starting point of the roller coaster (implement this concept in the design of the roller coaster)

## Elaborate
Students combine their tracks and their base to produce a structure that has the greatest gravitational potential energy 

## Evaluate
Test the designs for safety, design, and innovation

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| MS-PS2-2      | Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object | Explore |
| MS-PS3-2      | Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different amounts of potential energy are stored in the system |   Explore, Explain |
| MS-PS3-5      | Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object |   Explore, Explain |
| MS-ETS1-2 	| Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the chance in an object’s motion depends on the sum of forces on the object and the mass of the object   |   Explore |
