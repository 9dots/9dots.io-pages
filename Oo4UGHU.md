## Setup
### Materials:

- Materials to test for conductivity (tin foil, pencil graphite, paper, etc...)
- Makey Makey
- Computers (1 per Makey Makey)

## Engage
Watch the [Makey Makey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU) to get students excited and thinking about possible designs for their controllers.

## Explain
### Circuits
**What is a circuit?**
A circuit is a pathway made out of wires that allows electrons (electricity) to flow through it.

A circuit has to be complete (or closed) for the electrons to flow.
