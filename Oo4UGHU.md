## Setup
### Materials:

- Materials to test for conductivity (tin foil, pencil graphite, paper, etc...)
- Makey Makey
- Computers (1 per Makey Makey)

## Engage
### Watch:
Watch the [Makey Makey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU) to get students excited and thinking about possible designs for their controllers.

## Explain
### Circuits:
A circuit is a pathway made out of wires that allows electrons (electricity) to flow through it.
A circuit has to be complete (or closed) for the electrons to flow.

A circuit has 3 important parts:

1. Power Source
2. Load (What to power such as a light bulb)
3. Conductive Wire

### Conductivity:
Tells us how well a material will allow electricity to travel through it.

**Metals** have electrons that can flow freely, making them the best conductors.

**Nonmetals** have electrons that are stuffed close together, so they are poor conductors.

Show students the periodic table. Using the handout, students will determine whether or not a material is conductive by looking at it's elements in the table. 

## Explore
Using the Makey Makey and it's alligator clips, students will test the conductivity of different materials provided to them. Check the wiki on how to use the Makey Makey.

## Elaborate
Students will design and connect their own controllers using the Makey Makey. To test the functionality of their controller, students whould navigate to this [website](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2543877/) and use it to play the piano.
