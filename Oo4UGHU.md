## Lesson Overview
Students learn about basic circuits and conductivity through hand on testing of various materials. After they have determined which materials can be used, students use those materials to create a game controller using a Makey Makey. To test their creation, students connect the Makey Makey to a computer and play a browswer based piano using their custom buttons.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Materials to test for conductivity (tin foil, pencil graphite, paper, etc...)
- Makey Makey
- Computers (1 per Makey Makey)
- [Makey Makey powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oo4VuH6.pptx)
- [Makey Makey handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OsyrTd5.docx)

### Preparations:

- Set up projector with [Makey Makey powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oo4VuH6.pptx)

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 2 minutes
Watch the [Makey Makey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU) to get students excited and thinking about possible designs for their controllers.

## Explore - 8 minutes
Students have eight minutes to test the conductivity of different materials provided to them by using the Makey Makey. 

- Check the [wiki]() on how to use the Makey Makey.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Teach student about basic circuits and what makes some materials better conductors of electricity than other materials.

1. A circuit is a pathway made out of wires that allows electrons (electricity) to flow through it.

2. A circuit has to be complete (or closed) for the electrons to flow.

3. A circuit has 3 important parts:
  1. Power Source
  2. Load (What to power such as a light bulb)
  3. Conductive Wire

4. Tells us how well a material will allow electricity to travel through it.
	- **Metals** have electrons that can flow freely, making them the best conductors.
	- **Nonmetals** have electrons that are stuffed close together, so they are poor conductors.

5. Show students the periodic table on the projector. Using the handout, students will determine whether or not a material is conductive by looking at it's elements in the table. 

## Elaborate - 25 minutes
Students will design their own controller and connect it to the computer using the Makey Makey. 

1. Students design and connect their own controllers using the Makey Makey. 

2. To test the functionality of their controller, students should navigate to this [website](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2543877/) and use it to play the piano.
