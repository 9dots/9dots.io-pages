title: Mouse Trap Cars
blurb: Students will design a car powered by the elastic potential energy of a mouse trap
org: 9dots

## Setup
**Materials** 
•1 mouse trap
•Cardboard (base and wheels)
•1' fishing line
•4 screw eye hooks
•2 skewers (axles)
•rubber bands to secure wheels
•cups of various diameters to use as wheel outlines

*Safety: disalarm mouse trap by removing arm from lever

## Engage
Show a closed mousetrap. Ask,  _does this mousetrap have energy?_  (most will say no)
Then ask,  _what are mousetraps used for? (to kill mice) If this mousetrap has no energy, how can it kill a mouse? _
Show how the mouse trap works.

Show a wind up car before winding it up. Ask,  _does this toy car have energy?_ 
Wind up car and release, show its motion. Ask, _how does it move on it’s own?_

## Explore
Question: How can we produce a design that will harness the potential energy from the mouse trap to power the car?

10 minutes to design their car on paper
30 minutes to build and test*
10 minutes to race 

*Project may only include provided materials

## Explain
Gravitational Potential energy
Kinetic energy

## Elaborate
Ask for unique designs (wheel size, frame size, axle length, etc.)
Ask how students think different designs might affect speed (i.e. bigger wheels = less rolling friction)

## Evaluate
Time to race!
