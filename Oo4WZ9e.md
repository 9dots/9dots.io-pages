objective: 
  - Explain how a mousetrap converts potential energy to kinetic energy
  - Explain how that conversion can power their vehicle

## Lesson Overview
Students learn about elastic potential energy and kinetic enrgy by creating a mouse trap car. Start by showing the car and the energy stored in the trap when the arm is pulled back. Then, teach students about elastic potential energy and what happens when it is converted to kinetic energy. Students demonstrate learning by creating a mousetrap car that uses the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy generated by the mouse trap to power the car. 

## Setup
### Materials:

- 1 mouse trap
- Cardboard (base and wheels)
- 1' fishing line
- 4 screw eye hooks
- 2 skewers (axles)
- rubber bands to secure wheels
- cups of various diameters to use as wheel outlines

### Preparations:

- **Disarm mouse trap by removing arm from lever**
- Set up projector with [mousetrap cars powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ou0qNIl.pptx)
- Look at this [guide](http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Mousetrap-Car) for a tutorial on how to build the cars

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Introduce students to the mousetraps and show how it works to get them thinking about potential and kinetic energy.

1. Show a closed mousetrap. Ask, "_Does this mousetrap have energy?"_

2. Then ask,  _"What are mousetraps used for?"_
	- To kill mice. If this mousetrap has no energy, how can it kill a mouse?
    
3. Show how the mouse trap works.

4. Show a wind up car before winding it up. Ask,  _"Does this toy car have energy?"_ 

5. Wind up car and release, show its motion. Ask, _"How does it move on it’s own?"_

## Explain - 10 minutes
Teach students about elastic potential and kinetic energy and how they relate to the movement of a mousetrap car.

1. **Elastic Potential Energy**: The energy stored in elastic materials as the result of their stretching or compression.
	- The energy will be stored in the mousetrap. As the spring is further compressed (deformed from original position), the energy will build as it is compressed to its maximum point. Releasing the latch will release the stored energy as the spring returns to its original position.

2. **Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.
	- Energy is transformed from Elastic potential energy to kinetic energy. As the mousetrap car stops moving, the energy transformation is from kinetic to elastic potential energy. 

## Elaborate - 20 minutes
During this elaborate time, students build their unique design for a mousetrap car.

1. Students should build their cars with a unique design (wheel size, frame size, axle length, etc.).

2. Ask how students think different designs might affect speed (i.e. bigger wheels = less rolling friction).
