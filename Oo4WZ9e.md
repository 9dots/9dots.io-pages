## Setup
### Materials 

- 1 mouse trap
- Cardboard (base and wheels)
- 1' fishing line
- 4 screw eye hooks
- 2 skewers (axles)
- rubber bands to secure wheels
- cups of various diameters to use as wheel outlines

```
SAFETY: disarm mouse trap by removing arm from lever
```

## Engage
Show a closed mousetrap. Ask,  _does this mousetrap have energy?_  (most will say no)
Then ask,  _what are mousetraps used for? (to kill mice) If this mousetrap has no energy, how can it kill a mouse? _
Show how the mouse trap works.

Show a wind up car before winding it up. Ask,  _does this toy car have energy?_ 
Wind up car and release, show its motion. Ask, _how does it move on it’s own?_

## Explore
Question: How can we produce a design that will harness the potential energy from the mouse trap to power the car?

10 minutes to design their car on paper
30 minutes to build and test*
10 minutes to race 

```
Project may only include provided materials
```
## Explain

**Elastic Potential Energy**: The energy stored in elastic materials as the result of their stretching or compression.

- Application: The energy will be stored in the mousetrap. As the spring is further compressed (deformed from original position), the energy will build as it is compressed to its maximum point. Releasing the latch will release the stored energy as the spring returns to its original position.

**Kinetic Energy**: The energy of motion.

- Application: Energy is transformed from Elastic potential energy to kinetic energy. As the mousetrap car stops moving, the energy transformation is from kinetic to elastic potential energy. 

## Elaborate
Ask for unique designs (wheel size, frame size, axle length, etc.)
Ask how students think different designs might affect speed (i.e. bigger wheels = less rolling friction)

## Evaluate
Time to race!

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| MS-PS2-2      | Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object | Explain |
| MS-PS3-5      | Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object |   Explore |
| MS-ETS1-2 	| Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the chance in an object’s motion depends on the sum of forces on the object and the mass of the object   |   Explore |
