## Setup
**Materials** 
•12"x12" sheet of aluminum foil
•Pennies for testing
 
## Engage
Tear two piece of similar size aluminum foil to show students.
Keep one piece flat and crumple the second piece as tightly as possible.
Ask, _which, if either, will float and which, if either, will sink? Why?_
Demonstrate the flat piece floats while the crumpled piece sinks, though they are the same mass.
 
Ask, _why?_ (shape, size, density are possible answers)
 
## Explore
Question: How can a single sheet of foil be folded in such a way to float and hold as many pennies as possible?

Design on paper 10 minutes
Fold and test for 20 minutes
 
## Explain
Density is the amount of stuff (liquid, gas, solid) that's jam packed into a given space (provide visual example)

- Application: Anyone who has ever tried to lift something out of water knows it is harder than lifting that object outside in regular air. Why?
- The force of gravity pulls the boat downward, while there is a liquid applies a force that goes upward, this is called **buoyancy**
- In other words, an objects ability to float depends on multiple factors, including how much surface area is touching the water in comparison to it’s overall weight

**Density = mass/volume** 

- Show students 2 sheets of foil that are the same size again. Ask, _is the density for these two sheets the same? Why or why not?_
Fold one into a very loose sphere and one into a very tight sphere. Ask, _is the density for these two sheets the same? Why or why not?_

## Elaborate
Students get 1 new piece of foil to start from scratch, this time only given 10 minutes to apply new knowlege
 
## Evaluate
Test using pennies! Who has the safest, most buoyant boat?

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 5-PS2-1      | Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down |   Evaluate |
| MS-ETS1-1 	| Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution, taking into account relevant scientific principles and potential impacts on people and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions   |   Engage, Explore |
| MS-ETS1-3     | Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success | Elaborate |
