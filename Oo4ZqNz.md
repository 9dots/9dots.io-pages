## Setup
**Materials** 
•12"x12" sheet of aluminum foil
•Pennies for testing
 
## Engage
Tear two piece of similar size aluminum foil to show students.
Keep one piece flat and crumple the second piece as tightly as possible.
Ask, _which, if either, will float and which, if either, will sink? Why?_
Demonstrate the flat piece floats while the crumpled piece sinks, though they are the same mass.
 
Ask, _why?_ (shape, size, density are possible answers)
 
## Explore
Question: How can a single sheet of foil be folded in such a way to float and hold as many pennies as possible?

Design on paper 10 minutes
Fold and test for 20 minutes
 
## Explain
Density is the amount of stuff (liquid, gas, solid) that's jam packed into a given space (provide visual example)

Anyone who has ever tried to lift something out of water knows it is harder than lifting that object outside in regular air. Why?
•Liquid applies a force that goes upward, this is called buoyancy
•In other words, an objects ability to float depends on multiple factors, including how many surface area is touching the water in comparison to it’s overall weight
 
## Elaborate
Students get 1 new piece of foil to start from scratch, this time only given 10 minutes to apply new knowlege
 
## Evaluate
Test using pennies! Who has the safest, most buoyant boat?
