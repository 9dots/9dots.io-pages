## Lesson Overview

## Setup
### Materials:

- 12"x12" sheet of aluminum foil
- Pennies for testing

### Preparations:

- Fill a bucket with water to test the tin foil boats in
- Print the [tin boats handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OoorjpS.docx)
- Set up a projector with the [tin foil boats powerpoint]()

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes
 
## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Tear two piece of similar size aluminum foil to show students.
Keep one piece flat and crumple the second piece as tightly as possible.

2. Ask, _/'Which, if either, will float and which, if either, will sink? Why?/'_
	- Demonstrate the flat piece floats while the crumpled piece sinks, though they are the same mass.
 
3. Ask, _why?_ (shape, size, density are possible answers)
 
## Explore - 15 minutes
Using the 

1. Ask, _"How can a single sheet of foil be folded in such a way to float and hold as many pennies as possible?"_

2. Students have 5 minutes to design their boat on paper.

3. After they design the boat, students create it using their supplies.

4. Test the tin foil boats by putting them in the bucket of water and adding pennies to the boat until it sinks.
 
## Explain - 10 minutes

1. Density is the amount of stuff (liquid, gas, solid) that's jam packed into a given space (provide visual example).

2. **Density = mass/volume** 

3. Anyone who has ever tried to lift something out of water knows it is harder than lifting that object outside in regular air. Why?
	- The force of gravity pulls the boat downward, while there is a liquid applies a force that goes upward, this is called **buoyancy**.
	- In other words, an objects ability to float depends on multiple factors, including how much surface area is touching the water in comparison to it’s overall weight.

4. Show students 2 sheets of foil that are the same size again. Ask, _is the density for these two sheets the same? Why or why not?_

5. Fold one into a very loose sphere and one into a very tight sphere. Ask, _is the density for these two sheets the same? Why or why not?_

## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Students get 1 new piece of foil to start from scratch, this time only given 10 minutes to apply new knowlege
 
## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test using pennies! Who has the safest, most buoyant boat?

## Standards
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 5-PS2-1      | Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down |   Evaluate |
| MS-ETS1-1 	| Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution, taking into account relevant scientific principles and potential impacts on people and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions   |   Engage, Explore |
| MS-ETS1-3     | Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success | Elaborate |
