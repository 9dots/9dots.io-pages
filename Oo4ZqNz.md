## Setup
**Materials** 
•12"x12" sheet of aluminum foil
•Pennies for testing
 
## Engage
Show a closed mousetrap. Ask,  _does this mousetrap have energy?_  (most will say no)
Then ask,  _what are mousetraps used for? (to kill mice) If this mousetrap has no energy, how can it kill a mouse? _
Show how the mouse trap works.
 
Show a wind up car before winding it up. Ask,  _does this toy car have energy?_ 
Wind up car and release, show its motion. Ask, _how does it move on it’s own?_
 
## Explore
Question: How can we produce a design that will harness the potential energy from the mouse trap to power the car?
 
10 minutes to design their car on paper
30 minutes to build and test*
10 minutes to race 
 
*Project may only include provided materials
 
## Explain
Gravitational Potential energy
Kinetic energy
 
## Elaborate
Ask for unique designs (wheel size, frame size, axle length, etc.)
Ask how students think different designs might affect speed (i.e. bigger wheels = less rolling friction)
 
## Evaluate
Time to race!
