## Lesson Overview
This lesson provides an exploration driven introduction into coding with Scratch. Students start by watching a video that demonstrates the possibilites with Scratch. Then, they will follow a step-by-step guide available on Scratch to try out the programming. Students will demonstrate learning by modifying their program with some original code at the end of the lesson.

## Setup

### Materials:

- Computer with internet access
- Scratch account for students
- [Scratch powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/OoAHNhe.pptx)

### Project Time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage

1. Discuss, _What are different ways that you interact with computers? How many of those ways include you creating something on the computer?_

2. During this project, students use scratch to create their own interactive media. Show the video about scratch on http://scratch.mit.edu/about/. 

## Explore

1. Give students 5 minutes to explore different projects on the Scratch website. When they look at the projects, students should use the **See Inside** button to look at the programming that goes into creating a scratch project. 

2. Encourage students to try changing the values in the programming and see how it changes the project.

## Explain

1. Students need to start by creating an account for scratch. When this is completed, push the **Create** button at the top of the page to get started.  On the right side of the screen there is a question mark which, when clicked, reveals the tutorials. 

2. For an introduction into scratch, students should make the cat do a dance following the steps in the **Getting Started with Scratch** step-by-step guide. 

3. When they have finished creating their program, students should add comments to their project describing what each block accomplishes. To add a comment, right click on the block and select **add comment**.

## Elaborate

1. Students have 10 minutes to explore scratch. Use the prompt, _make something surprising happen when you click on the sprite._

2. Students are encouraged to help other students by explaining what they discover and work together.
