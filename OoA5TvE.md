## Setup
### Materials:

- Computer with internet access
- Scratch account for students

## Engage
### Discuss
Ask, _What are different ways that you interact with computers? How many of those ways include you creating something on the computer?_

### Watch
During this project, students will use scratch to create their own interactive media. Show the video about scratch on http://scratch.mit.edu/about/. 

## Explore
### Look Around
Students will take 5 minutes to explore different projects on the Scratch website. When they look at the projects, students will use the **See Inside** button to look at the programming that goes into creating a scratch project. 

### Tinker
Encourage students to try changing the values in the programming and see how it changes the project.

## Explain
###Getting Started
Students will need to start by creating an account for scratch. When this is completed, push the **Create** button at the top of the page to get started.  On the right side of the screen there will be a question mark which, when clicked, will reveal the tutorials. 

### Guided Practice
For an introduction into scratch, students will make the cat do a dance following the steps in the **Getting Started with Scratch** step-by-step guide. 

### Check for understanding
When they have finished creating their program, students will add comments to their project describing what each block accomplishes. To add a comment, right click on the block and select **add comment**.

## Elaborate
Students have 10 minutes to explore scratch. Use the prompt, _make something surprising happen when you click on the sprite._

Students are encouraged to help other students by explaining what they discover and work together.
