## Setup

### Materials

- Computers with Minecraft installed
- Sustainable food handout

## Empathize
Day 2 of your Minecraft adventure. To recap, you have been shipwrecked on an island and discovered that there are monsters there. To help survive, your first task was to build shelter to protect yourself through the night and set up a home base for your crew.

## Define
Unfortunately, supplies are starting to run low, especially food. What should your next priority be?

Students should ask each other what they see as the biggest problem they are facing.

## Ideate
What are some possible solutions to solving the problem that students identified? Are there some solutions that would be more sustainable than others? How would you apply these ideas in Minecraft?

Create a wheat farm. Students will be provided with the materials required to get their farm started. Here are the things they will need:
- Water
- Hoe (to till the dirt)
- Seeds
- Bone Meal (makes the wheat grow fast)

To create a wheat farm, you will first need to dig an irrigation ditch for water. The wheat will only grow within 4 blocks of a water source. Put a fence around your farm to make sure your crops donâ€™t get trampled.

Using the handout, students will draw a diagram of their proposed farm, including labels for the wheat, water, and fences.

## Prototype
Time to go into Minecraft and try out the solutions that students have developed. As students will be working in groups of two, it is a good idea for them to try multiple solutions instead of just one. Then, if one solution turns out to be more successful, students can pivot their resources into the better idea.
