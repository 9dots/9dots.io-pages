## Overview
In this unit, students will be designing and prototyping their own product that they will make using the littleBits. When their product is completed, students will develop a sales pitch to present to a panel of judges. In this lesson, students will explore the various littleBits components and how they interact.

## Setup 

### Materials:

- littleBits (separated by input / output / power)
- [littleBits handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OreA5Fy.pdf)
- [Product Design Day 1 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/OreAoGn.pptx)

### Preparations:

- Project the Product Design Day 1 powerpoint

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Give the students an introduction to the littleBits that they will be using during this unit and get them excited by watching a video that showcases the power of littleBits.

1. Show the littleBits video found at the beginning of the powerpoint. 
	- On their littleBits handouts, students will fill in at least three examples of devices they saw in the video.
2. littleBits are a way to learn and prototype with electronics. They are magnetic circuits that can perform actions. 

## Explain - 15 minutes
Teach students about how the littleBits sensors mimic human senses and give examples of sensors used in everyday life.

1. Discuss with students the five senses that humans have.
	- Smell
    - Sight
    - Touch
    - Taste
    - Hear
2. The senses are used to respond to the outside environment, such as:
	- if we feel something is too hot, we move our hand away
	- if we see candy we want to have, we grab it
	- if we hear our dog running away, we call their name
	- if we taste something bad, we spit it out

3. Just like with the body, in electronic senses are called “sensors”.
	- A sensor is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. 
    - A sensor is used to measure a physical quantity such as temperature, pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g a voltage).
    
4. Some examples of sensors from real life include:
	- Fire alarm – sense smoke in the air and turn on noise
	- Light switch – sense motion and turn on light
	- Clap on clap off lights – sense sound and turn on light
    
5. The sensors for littleBits are called **inputs** and have pink edges.

6. The littleBits that do an action are called **outputs** and have green edges.

7. To power a littleBits circuit you need a blue **power supply**.

8. The order of the littleBits circuit should be power supply -> input -> output

## Explore - 20 minutes
A hands on exploration of littleBits using the littleBits handout to organize what students discover.

1. Distribute the littleBits handout.

2. Using the handout, students will build circuits using different input and output combinations.
	- After creating a circuit, students will write down the result on the handout. This includes writing the name of the input, the name of the output, and a sentence explaining what happens when the input is triggered.

3. Give some specific goals such as:
	- Make a light turn on when I push a button
    - Turn on a motor when motion is detected
    - Make a noise when sound it hears a sound

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

1. What is a sensor?

2. How is a sensor similar to human senses?

3. What is an output?

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem | Elaborate |
