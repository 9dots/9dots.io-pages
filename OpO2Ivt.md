## Setup 

### Materials:

- Little Bits (separated by input / output / power)
- Little Bits input output handout

## Engage

Show the Little Bits video. What are Little Bits? What are some cool uses for Little Bits that you saw in the video? 

In this unit, students will be designing and prototyping their own product that they will make using the Little Bits. When their product is completed, students will develop a sales pitch to present to a panel of judges.

## Explore

Today, students are going to learn about electronic sensors. 
What are the senses that the human body has?

- Sight
- Touch
- Taste
- Sound
- Smell


What are the senses in the body used for?
The senses are used to respond to the outside environment, such as:

- if we feel something is too hot, we move our hand away
- if we see candy we want to have, we grab it
- if we hear our dog running away, we call their name
- if we taste something bad, we spit it out

## Explain

Just like with the body, in electronic senses are called “sensors”. A sensor is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. A sensor is used to measure a physical quantity such as temperature, pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g a voltage).
Some examples of sensors from real life include:

- Fire alarm – sense smoke in the air and turn on noise
- Light switch – sense motion and turn on light
- Clap on clap off lights – sense sound and turn on light

## Elaborate

Using the handout, students will build circuits using different input and output combinations, and write down the result on the handout.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem | Elaborate |
