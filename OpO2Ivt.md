## Overview
In this unit, students will be designing and prototyping their own product that they will make using the littleBits. When their product is completed, students will develop a sales pitch to present to a panel of judges. In this lesson, students will explore the various littleBits components and how they interact.

## Setup 

### Materials:

- Little Bits (separated by input / output / power)
- Little Bits input output handout

## Engage

1. Show the Little Bits video found at the beginning of the powerpoint. 
	- On their handouts, students will fill in at least three examples of devices they saw in the video.
2. Little Bits are a way to learn and prototype with electronics. They are magnetic circuits that can perform actions. 

## Explain

1. Discuss with students the five senses that humans have.
	- Smell
    - Sight
    - Touch
    - Taste
    - Hear
2. The senses are used to respond to the outside environment, such as:
	- if we feel something is too hot, we move our hand away
	- if we see candy we want to have, we grab it
	- if we hear our dog running away, we call their name
	- if we taste something bad, we spit it out

## Explain

1. Just like with the body, in electronic senses are called “sensors”.
	- A sensor is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. 
    - A sensor is used to measure a physical quantity such as temperature, pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g a voltage).
    
2. Some examples of sensors from real life include:
	- Fire alarm – sense smoke in the air and turn on noise
	- Light switch – sense motion and turn on light
	- Clap on clap off lights – sense sound and turn on light

## Explore

1. Using the handout, students will build circuits using different input and output combinations
	- After creating a circuit, students will write down the result on the handout.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem | Elaborate |
