## Setup
### Materials:

- Computers with Minecraft
- Minecraft Day 4 handout

## Scenario

Now that students have established shelters, have learned the skills for harvesting food and making goods, it is time to design a network. A community can only exist through collaboration and communication. Students will design infrastructure systems to allow for easier collaboration and communication.
Empathize

### Ask students:
How do you feel with only one partner? What do you think a community in the real world would be like if there was only 1 or 2 people trying to make it last? 

## Define

Students will define the problem that they are trying to solve. The problem should be along the lines of “It is hard to be a community without proper systems in place.”

## Ideate

How do villages, cities, and even countries communicate? What systems are in place?

What can you add to our server to make this possible? Draw and discuss with your partners.
Examples include systems for keeping plants watered, a system for traveling from one shelter to another, a system for keeping livestock close to your shelter, etc...

## Prototype

In the game, students will create infrastructure to make their society run smoothly.

## Standards

Standard | Description | Connection
--- | --- | ---
3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. | Define
3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate
MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Prototype
