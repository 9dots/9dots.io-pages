## Lesson Overview
So far, students have learned to [create shelters](), [designed a sustainable food source](), and [crafted essentials for survival](). To complete their settlement students will develop infrastructure to connect their houses, and create more efficient farms.

## Setup
### Materials:

- Computers with Minecraft
- [Minecraft Day 4 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oqi5hsR.docx)
- [Minecraft Day 4 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oqi5fg5.pptx)

### Preparations:

1. Distribute the [Minecraft Day 4 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oqi5hsR.docx)
2. Set up the [Minecraft Day 4 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Oqi5fg5.pptx) to lead the discussion

## Empathize
Provide the students with the current scenario for their characters and get them thinking about how those characters would be feeling.

1. Ask students, "What have you accomplished so far in Minecraft?"
	- Created shelters to protect from monsters
    - Designed farms for sustainable food growth
    - Used mining and crafting to create 
2. Discuss how the situation would feel for thier character
	- How do you feel with only one partner? 
    - What do you think a community in the real world would be like if there was only 1 or 2 people trying to make it last? 

## Define
Students will discuss and decide what their problem statement will be for this lesson.

1. Give students five minutes to discuss the situation with their partner
2. Have one to two groups share their problem statement with the group
	- The problem should be along the lines of “It is hard to be a community without proper systems in place.”

## Ideate
Come up with ideas of how to design a solution for the problem that they have just written down.

1. Discuss how do villages, cities, and even countries communicate?
	- Communities have systems in place to help communicate. Some examples are:
    	- The postal service delivering mail
        - The internet to send and recieve data and messages
        - Roads and trains to travel to keep people connected physically

2. What could students add to the server to make this possible?

	- Give students five minutes to discuss with their partner
	- Students will draw and diagram their plans for connecting their settlement
	- Examples include a system for traveling from one shelter to another using the rail system, creating a mail system (place a chest on a post to create a mailbox), and using the Minecraft chat to communicate

** For more information on the rail system check out this [Minecraft rail tutorial](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Train_station)**

## Prototype
Time for students to test their design by building them in the game.

1. In the game, students will create infrastructure to make their society run smoothly.

## Standards


Standard | Description | Connection
--- | --- | ---
3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. | Define
3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate
MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Prototype
