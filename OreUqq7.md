objective: 
  - Define a minimum viable product
  - Create their first prototype based on their designs
blurb: "Students learn about the concept of a minimum viable product and its importance for designers. Then, they begin building their product using their plans from the [brainstorming lesson](). During building, emphasize the importance of testing and iteration to create the best possible product. Students demonstrate learning by following design thinking principles as they build their prototypes. #NGSS-3-5-ETS1-2 #NGSS-MS-ETS1-2  #NGSS-MS-ETS1-4"

## Setup 

### Materials:

- [Brainstorming handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OsJQoTy.docx)
- littleBits
- Cardboard
- Tape
- String
- Rubber Bands
- Cups

### Preparations:

- Give each group their brainstorming handout from the previous lesson
- Set up a projector with the powerpoint

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Introduction - 5 minutes 

Students start making a prototype using the design that they created during the last lesson. 

1. Discuss with students the importance of prototyping and iterating. 
	- Prototyping allows designers to test their products in a basic form before going into a major production.
    - Iteration is the process of prototyping, testing, and then fixing any problems that were discovered in a new version of the product to create the best possible version of the product.

2. Students should not get too attached to their first design, and should restart with a new design if the first one can be improved. 

3. The goal for students in this unit is to create a **Minimum Viable Product** or (mvp) to present to a panel of judges.  
	- The mvp is the most basic version of a product that can be tested. 
    - This is important for a start-up company that does not have a lot of money to spend on a product that may not sell well.

## Ideate - 5 minutes 

Students should take time to review their designs from the previous lesson, and make sure to have a finished diagram of their proposed prototype. 

1. Students should ensure that their diagrams are accurate and precise.

2. The littleBits that the group will need should be clearly stated in the brainstorming document.

## Prototype - 35 minutes

1. Students start prototyping their product using cardboard, littleBits, and other materials that you woud like to provide for them. 
	- Students should not be afraid to throw away a design and start over if does not work out the first time. 

2. Check for understanding by asking, "What does iteration mean?"

```
TIP: Students should only be allowed to use the littleBits from their diagrams because it is easy for them to be distracted by just playing with the littleBits.
```

## Test

When a group has finished building their prototype, they should test it by letting someone who was not involved in building try to use it.

1. Students observe someone else using their product.

2. As the tester is using their product, students should take notes on what works well.
	- Is the product intuitive (does the tester know how to use it without instructions)?
    - Does the product function as expected?
    - Ask the tester for additional feedback.

3. After testing, students start the design process again by defining the problem that the tester found with their product.
	- Use the brainstorming handout again to help students organize their thoughts on their second run through the design thinking process.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------ |
| NGSS-3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate |
| NGSS-MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Test |
| NGSS-MS-ETS1-4 | Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved. | Test |
