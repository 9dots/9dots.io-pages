objective: SWBAT use the EV3 programming environment to develop a program for their robot that can guide it through a maze.

---

## Lesson Overview
Students will continue learning about programming by building on the [Introduction to EV3 Programming](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQXe4e) lesson. Students will start by learning about how to program in the EV3 environment and download their programs to the robot for testing. Finally, they will test their robots on the maze and keep a log of their tests. 

## Setup

### Materials:

- Finished robot from [Robotic Engineering](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OJ8iMiY)
- Hand written program and lego attachment from [Introduction to EV3 Programming](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQXe4e)
- Computers with EV3 software
- [Move Steering Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os1oGrk.docx)

### Preparations:

- Distribute the [Move Steering Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os1oGrk.docx)

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage
To get the students interested, show them a video of a very well designed and programmed EV3 robot.

1. Show the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzDjg595AiU) of the world champion robot from 2013-14 First Lego League challenge.

2. Discuss with students the importance of combining good engineering and good programming.

## Explain 
Teach students how to use the move steering block to accomplish a simple behavior. Students will follow along on the Move Steering handout.

1. In the Mindstorm EV3 software, to program the robot, drag blocks from the bottom bar and connect them to the start block that is on the screen. 
	- To program the Mindstorm Robot, students will use the same 3 simple behaviors; move straight, turn left, and turn right. 
	- The three behaviors that have been discussed are all achievable using the Move Steering block.

2. Students will fill in the 3 parts of the Move Steering block on their handout:
	- *Turning:* Positive numbers turn right, Negative numbers turn left, and 0 means straight.
	- *Power:* How fast the motor will spin. 0 is the slowest; 100 is the fastest.
	- *Duration:* How long the motor will turn on for in rotations. 1 rotation is one full spin of the motor.

3. To make a complex behavior, connect as many Move Steering blocks (simple behaviors) together as are required.

4. On the handout, students will describe the behaviors for each move steering block. The finished answer should look like this:

## Explore
Show students the maze from the previous lesson to remind them of what their robot will need to navvigate. Students will go begin programming their robot to complete the maze.

1. Demonstrate how to download a program to the robot. 
	- A how to on downloading programs to the EV3 can be found in the Wiki section of 9dots.io.

2. Groups should be as small as possible with one computer per group. 

3. Each team has 35 minutes to build an attachment and program their robot to complete the maze. 
	- Students should use their program (the written down instructions) from the ‘teacher robot’ activity to help with organizing the behaviors for the actual maze challenge.

## Evaluate
Students will test their programs and keep a log of where each attempt could be improved.

1. Students may test their robot at any point. 
2. After each attempt, students should write down what worked and what they should change using the [iteration log handout]().
