objective: "SWBAT define a minimum viable product, and create their first prototype based on their designs."

## Lesson Overview
Students will learn about the concept of a minimum viable product and its importance for designers. Then, they will begin building their product using their plans from the brainstorming lesson. During building, emphasize the importance of testing and iteration to create the best possible product. Students will demonstrate learning by following design thinking principles as they build their prototypes.

## Setup 

### Materials:

- Little Bits
- Cardboard
- Tape
- String
- Rubber Bands
- Cups

### Preparations:

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Introduction

Students will start making a prototype using the design that they created during the last lesson. 

1. Discuss with students the importance of prototyping and iterating. 
	- Prototyping allows designers to test their products in a basic form before going into a major production.
    - Iteration is the act of 

2. Students should not get too attached to their first design, and should restart with a new design if the first one can be improved. 

3. The goal for students in this unit is to create a **Minimum Viable Product** or (mvp) to present to a panel of judges.  
	- The mvp is the most basic version of a product that can be tested. 
    - This is important for a start-up company that does not have a lot of money to spend on a product that may not sell well.

## Ideate

Students should take time to review their designs from the previous lesson, and make sure to have a finished diagram of their proposed prototype. 

1. Students should ensure that their diagrams are accurate and precise.

2. The littleBits that the group will need should be clearly stated in the brainstorming document.

## Prototype

Students will start prototyping their product using cardboard, littleBits, and other materials that you woud like to provide for them. 

- Students should not be afraid to throw away a design and start over if does not work out the first time. 
- The process of trying many design is called iteration and is important to creating a good product.

```
TIP: Students should only be allowed to use the littleBits from their diagrams because it is easy for them to be distracted by just playing with the littleBits.
```

## Test

If a group has finished building their prototype, they should test it by letting someone who was not involved in building try to use it.

1. Students will observe someone else using their product.

2. As the tester is using their product, students should take notes on what works well.
	- Is the product intuitive (does the tester know how to use it without instructions)?
    - Does the product function as expected?
    - Ask the tester for additional feedback.
