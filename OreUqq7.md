## Lesson Overview

## Setup 

### Materials:

- Little Bits
- Cardboard
- Tape
- String
- Rubber Bands
- Cups

## Introduction

Students will start making a prototype using the design that they created during the last lesson. Discuss with students the importance of prototyping and iterating. Students should not get too attached to their first design, and should restart with a new design if the first one can be improved. 

Minimum Viable Product:
The goal for students in this unit is to create a Minimum Viable Product or (mvp) to present to a panel of judges.  The mvp is the most basic version of a product that can be tested. This is important for a start-up company that does not have a lot of money to spend on a product that may not sell well.

## Ideate

Students should take time to review their designs from the previous lesson, and make sure to have a finished diagram of their proposed prototype. 

## Prototype

Students will start prototyping their product using cardboard and Little Bits. Students should not be afraid to throw away a design and start over if does not work out the first time. The process of trying many design is called iteration and is important to creating a good product.

## Test
