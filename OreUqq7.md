## Lesson Overview
Students will continue learning about programming by building on the [Introduction to EV3 Programming](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQXe4e) lesson. Students will start by learning about how to program in the EV3 environment and download their programs to the robot for testing. Finally, they will test their robots on the maze and keep a log of their tests. 

## Setup

### Materials:

- Finished robot from [Robotic Engineering](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OJ8iMiY)
- Hand written program and lego attachment from [Introduction to EV3 Programming](http://www.9dots.io/9dots/OiQXe4e)
- Computers with EV3 software

### Preparations:

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage

## Explain 
Teach students how to use the move steering block to accomplish a simple behavior. 

1. In the Mindstorm EV3 software, to program the robot, drag blocks from the bottom bar and connect them to the start block that is on the screen. 
	- To program the Mindstorm Robot, students will use the same 3 simple behaviors; move straight, turn left, and turn right. 
	- The three behaviors that have been discussed are all achievable using the Move Steering block.

2. The 3 parts of the Move Steering block are:
	- *Turning:* Positive numbers turn right, Negative numbers turn left, and 0 means straight.
	- *Power:* How fast the motor will spin. 0 is the slowest; 100 is the fastest.
	- *Duration:* How long the motor will turn on for in rotations. 1 rotation is one full spin of the motor.

3. To make a complex behavior, connect as many Move Steering blocks (simple behaviors) together as are required.

## Explore
Students will go begin programming their robot to complete the tasks.

1. Demonstrate how to download a program to the robot. 
	- A how to on downloading programs to the EV3 can be found in the Wiki section of 9dots.io.

2. Groups should be as small as possible with one computer per group. 

3. Each team has 35 minutes to build an attachment and program their robot to complete the maze. 
	- Students should use their program (the written down instructions) from the ‘teacher robot’ activity to help with organizing the behaviors for the actual maze challenge.

## Evaluate
Students may test their robot at any point. After each attempt, students should write down what worked and what they should change using this handout.
