# Day 1

## Lesson Overview
Using the design thinking process, students will create a cardboard crane powered by littleBits. The lesson will begin by establishing that the goal for students is to lift weights from the floor up to their desks using limited supplies. Students will define the problem and then begin to generate solution ideas. Students will begin to prototype their ideas using littleBits, cardboard, string, tape, paper clips, and a straw.

## Setup 

### Materials:

- littleBits
	- DC Motor
	- Wire
	- Power Supply
	- Input (for controlling crane)
- Cardboard
- String
- Tape
- Paper Clip
- Straw
- [littleBits Day 2 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os2Hrwh.pdf)
- [littleBits Day 2 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os2HfpH.pptx)

### Preparations:
- Distribute the [littleBits Day 2 handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os2Hrwh.pdf)
- Project the [littleBits Day 2 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os2HfpH.pptx)

### Project Time:
- 45 minutes

## Empathize - 5 minutes
Explain to students the scenario that they are going to find a solution for.

1. You are working on building a skyscraper, and need to lift a lot of heavy pieces to continue construction. 

2. Right now, you do not have any machine to help you lift. 

3. Lead a brief discussion with students about how they would feel in that situation.
	- Students will write their answers on the littleBits Day 2 handout.

## Define - 5 minutes
After students discuss how they feel about the situation, they will define the problem in simple terms.

1. Discuss with students what the problem is.
	- An example of the problem statement could read, "There is no way to lift the heavy pieces to the top of the building."
2. Students will write their problem statement on their handouts.

## Ideate - 10 minutes
After seeing the materials that they have available to them, students will develop a design solution to their problem.

1. Show students the materials that they have available to them. These are:
	- littleBits
	- Cardboard
	- String
	- Paper Clip
	- Straw
	- Tape
    
2. Show the picture of a littleBits crane from the powerpoint.

2. Students will begin creating a diagram of their crane. When they are designing, students should consider:
	- Which littleBits outputs could you use to help create a crane?
		- The DC Motor is required to spin and roll up the string.
	- Which input do you want to use to control when the crane moves?
    	- Students can choose any littleBits input to control their crane.
	- How can you use the cardboard to stabilize the crane?
		- Build a structure with the cardboard to keep the littleBits from sliding because of the weight.

## Prototype - 25 minutes
Students will start to build their design using the provided materials. This project will be finished as part of the next lesson.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 3-5-ETS1-1 | Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost | Define |
| 3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem | Ideate |
| MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem | Prototype |

# Day 2

## Lesson Overview
Students will complete the cardboard cranes that they started in the previous lesson. When students complete their prototype, they will test them by attaching a weight to the string. After testing, they will assess the strengths and weaknesses of their design and adjust their prototype accordingly.

## Setup

### materials:

- Cranes from previous lesson
- littleBits
	- DC Motor
	- Wire
	- Power Supply
	- Input (for controlling crane)
- Cardboard
- String
- Tape
- Paper Clip
- Straw

### project time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage
Start the day off by discussing the importance of prototyping and testing to creating a great product.

1. What does it mean to prototype?
	- A prototype is a first version of a product used for testing.
 
2. Why is it important to test your prototype?
	- No matter how long you work on your prototype, your first design can always be improved upon. Testing your product allows the  design team to discover issues that they did not know existed.
    
3. Can you change your prototype once you have made it?
	- Yes! It is important to not get too attached to one design because testing may reveal that it does not work well as planned.
    
## Prototype
Students will continue to create their original design for their cranes. Remind students that this is important to get their first prototype done quickly so that they can move on to testing and then  revising their design.

## Test
When students have complete their prototypes, they will test their cranes by attaching weights to the end of the strings.

1. Students who have finished their prototype will attach weights (any object that can be tied up with a string) and test their design.

2. After testing, students will use the [iteration log]() to keep track of what could have worked better.

3. Students will modify their prototypes to reflect the design problems found during testing.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------ |
| MS-ETS1-3 | Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success | Prototype/Test |
| MS-ETS1-4 | Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved | Test |
