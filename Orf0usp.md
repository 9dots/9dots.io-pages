title: Cardboard Cranes
org: 9dots
objective: SWBAT create a motorized circuit to lift objects using littleBits and design an original solution to create a crane using limited supplies.
id: "9dots-Orf0usp"
blurb: "Students will practice the design process thinking to develop a solution for lifting legos off the ground using #littleBits."

## Setup 

### Materials:

- littleBits
	- DC Motor
	- Wire
	- Power Supply
	- Input (for controlling crane)
- Cardboard
- String
- Tape
- Paper Clip
- Straw

### Preparations:
- Distribute the littleBits Day 2 handout
- Project the littleBits Day 2 powerpoint

### Project Time:
- 45 minutes

## Empathize
Explain to students the scenario that they are going to find a solution for.

1. You are working on building a skyscraper, and need to lift a lot of heavy pieces to continue construction. 

2. Right now, you do not have any machine to help you lift. 

3. Lead a brief discussion with students about how they would feel in that situation.
	- Students will write their answers on the littleBits Day 2 handout.

## Define
After students discuss how they feel about the situation, they will define the problem in simple terms.

1. Discuss with students what the problem is.

2. Students will write their problem statement on their handouts.

## Ideate
After seeing the materials that they have available to them, students will develop a design solution to their problem.

1. Show students the materials that they have available to them. These are:
	- littleBits
	- Cardboard
	- String
	- Paper Clip
	- Straw
	- Tape

2. Students will begin creating a diagram of their crane. When they are designing, students should consider:
	- Which littleBits outputs could you use to help create a crane?
		- The DC Motor is required to spin and roll up the string.
	- Which input do you want to use to control when the crane moves?
    	- Students can choose any littleBits input to control their crane.
	- How can you use the cardboard to stabilize the crane?
		- Build a structure with the cardboard to keep the littleBits from sliding because of the weight.

## Prototype
Students will try to build their design using the provided materials.

## Test
Students will attach a weight to their crane and attempt to lift it from the floor up to the table.
