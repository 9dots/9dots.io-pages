## Lesson Overview
During this lesson, student learn about creating an effective sales pitch. After engaging students by watching a quick video clip, discuss 

## Setup

### Materials:

- Posters
- Markers
- [Sales pitch clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk)
- [Shark tank presentation handout]()

### Preparation:

- Write on the board:  What makes a good salesperson?

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage
Use a video clip and discussion to get students thinking about how to create a succesful sales pitch.

1. Watch the [sales pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk) from the movie Guilt Trip. 
**Make sure to stop the clip at 2:08 to avoid explicit content!**

2. Discuss, "_What makes a good sales person? What makes a bad one?_"
	- Chart out student responses on the whiteboard.

3. Today, students are working on the sales pitch that they will give to the judges during the next lesson. 
    
## Explore
During this explore, students try to quickly come up with a way to sell common items in the room (pencils, pens, paper) to the person sitting next to them. 

1. Break students into groups of two and them a simple object from the room to sell. This can be anything from pencils to chairs.

2. Each student has one minute to prepare a sales pitch for the object.

3. Students present their sales pitch to their partner.

## Explain
After students try a sales pitch on their own, use the powerpoint to lead a discussion about the steps required to create an effective sales pitch.

1. There are six steps to creating a successful sales pitch.  
  1. Research your client
  2. Know your product
  3. Set your objectives
  4. Greet your client right away
  5. Get to the point
