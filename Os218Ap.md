- [Shark tank presentation handout]()

### Preparation:

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage

1. Watch the [sales pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk) from the movie Guilt Trip. 
**Make sure to stop the clip at 2:08 to avoid explicit content!**

2. Discuss, "_What makes a good sales person? What makes a bad one?_"
	- Chart out student responses on the whiteboard.

3. Today, students will work on the sales pitch that they will give to the judges during the next lesson. 
	- By the end of the class, students will have finished a poster for their product, as well as practiced their presentation for the judges.

## Explain

1. There are six steps to creating a successful sales pitch.  Students will use these steps to craft a sales pitch for their product which they will be presenting in the following lesson.
  1. Research your client
  2. Know your product
  3. Set your objectives
  4. Greet your client right away
  5. Get to the point
  6. Make a two way conversation, not a lecture!

2. Using normal objects (pencils, paper, pens...) that they have in front of them, students will try to quickly come up with a way to sell it to the person sitting next to them. Students should remember to think about the six steps when they come up with their pitch.

## Elaborate

1. Students will use the sales pitch handout to help organize ideas for their presentation. 

2. Students will make posters for the shark tank presentation, concentrating on being good salespeople. For this project, it is important for students to work on having a good poster as well as practice their presentation.
