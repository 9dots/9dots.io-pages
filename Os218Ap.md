## Engage
Use a video clip and discussion to get students thinking about how to create a succesful sales pitch.

1. Watch the [sales pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk) from the movie Guilt Trip. 
**Make sure to stop the clip at 2:08 to avoid explicit content!**

2. Discuss, "_What makes a good sales person? What makes a bad one?_"
	- Chart out student responses on the whiteboard.

3. Today, students will work on the sales pitch that they will give to the judges during the next lesson. 
	- By the end of the class, students will have finished a poster for their product, as well as practiced their presentation for the judges.
    
## Explore
Using normal objects (pencils, paper, pens...) that they have in front of them, students will try to quickly come up with a way to sell it to the person sitting next to them. 

1. Break students into groups of two and them a simple object from the room to sell. This can be anything from pencils to chairs.

2. Each student has one minute to prepare a sales pitch for the object.

3. Students will present their sales pitch to their partner.

## Explain
After students try a sales pitch on their own, use the powerpoint to lead a discussion about the steps required to create an effective sales pitch.

1. There are six steps to creating a successful sales pitch.  
  1. Research your client
  2. Know your product
  3. Set your objectives
  4. Greet your client right away
  5. Get to the point
  6. Make a two way conversation, not a lecture!

2. Students will use these steps to craft a sales pitch for their product which they will be presenting in the following lesson.

## Elaborate
Using the sales pitch handout, students will work on developing a sales pitch for their original littleBits projects.

1. Students will use the sales pitch handout to help organize ideas for their presentation. 

2. Students will make posters for the shark tank presentation, concentrating on being good salespeople. For this project, it is important for students to work on having a good poster as well as practice their presentation.
