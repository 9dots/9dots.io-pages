## Lesson Overview
Students will complete the cardboard cranes that they started in the previous lesson. When students complete their prototype, they will test them by attaching a weight to the string. After testing, they will assess the strengths and weaknesses of their design and adjust their prototype accordingly.

## Setup

### materials:

- Cranes from previous lesson
- littleBits
	- DC Motor
	- Wire
	- Power Supply
	- Input (for controlling crane)
- Cardboard
- String
- Tape
- Paper Clip
- Straw

### preparations:

### project time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage

## Prototype

## Test

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------ |
| MS-ETS1-3 | Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success | Prototype/Test |
| MS-ETS1-4 | Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved | Test |
