## Lesson Overview


## Setup

### Materials:

- Posters
- Markers
- [Sales pitch clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk)
- [Shark tank presentation handout]()

### Preparation:

- Write on the board:  What makes a good salesperson?

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Engage
Use a video clip and discussion to get students thinking about how to create a succesful sales pitch.

1. Watch the [sales pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xJrw_h5Nk) from the movie Guilt Trip. 
**Make sure to stop the clip at 2:08 to avoid explicit content!**

2. Discuss, "_What makes a good sales person? What makes a bad one?_"
	- Chart out student responses on the whiteboard.

3. Today, students are working on the sales pitch that they will give to the judges during the next lesson. 
    
## Explore
During this explore, students try to quickly come up with a way to sell common items in the room (pencils, pens, paper) to the person sitting next to them. 

1. Break students into groups of two and them a simple object from the room to sell. This can be anything from pencils to chairs.

2. Each student has one minute to prepare a sales pitch for the object.

3. Students present their sales pitch to their partner.

## Explain
After students try a sales pitch on their own, use the powerpoint to lead a discussion about the steps required to create an effective sales pitch.

1. There are six steps to creating a successful sales pitch.  
  1. Research your client
  2. Know your product
  3. Set your objectives
  4. Greet your client right away
  5. Get to the point
  6. Make a two way conversation, not a lecture!

## Elaborate
Using the sales pitch handout, students work on developing a sales pitch for their original littleBits projects.

1. Give students five minutes to fill in the sales pitch handout.  This handout is used to help organize ideas for their presentation. 

2. When they finish the handout, students make posters for the shark tank presentation.
	- The visual aide will be an important piece of the presentation.

3. Students practice their presentation out loud to get more comfortable with the presentation.
