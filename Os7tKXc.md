## Lesson Overview
This lesson will be about generating ideas for a product to build using the littleBits. Students will begin by reviewing the design thinking process. Afterwards, they will use the first three steps of the process to brainstorm ideas for an original littleBits product to create.

## Setup 

### Materials:

- [Brainstorming products handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os7wlJA.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Distribute the [brainstorming products handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/Os7wlJA.pdf)
- Project the powerpoint to lead the discussion

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes

## Introduction
Review the design thinking process and get students thinking about possible products by browsing the littleBits project website.

1. Today marks the first day of students work on their original littleBits product. Review the steps of design thinking process with the students.

  1. Empathize
  2. Define
  3. Ideate
  4. Prototype
  5. Test
  
2. During this lesson, students will focus on the first three steps in the design process.  

3. To help generate ideas for their products, students will take five minutes to browse the [littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc) website and look at the projects section.

## Empathize
Students will discuss with their partner different problems that they have throughout a normal day for themselves. 

1. Students will discuss with a partner what kind of products they would like to create. 

2. What sort of product do you need? What would be a helpful product for your community?

## Define

Students will generate a problem definition based on an issue that they think can be solved by creating a product using littleBits.

## Ideate
Using the problem statement that they have just definded, students will generate ideas for products that they could create using littleBits.

1. Students will generate 3 idea for a product that they could create to help out their community. 

2. Students will refine their choices down to just one product that you want to work on. 

3. Once they have chosen, students will sketch a diagram for the product and come up with ideas for a name for that product.

## Standards

| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| NGSS-3-5-ETS1-2 | Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate |
| NGSS-MS-ETS1-1 | Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution, taking into account relevant scientific principles and potential impacts on people and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions. | Define |
| NGSS-MS-ETS1-2 | Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem. | Ideate |
