## Overview
Time to program a phone application! In this project, we will design and program a fully functioning Android phone app that can keep track of different foods and some nutritional facts! Your job as a designer and programmer is to select some of your favorite foods and learn about them, then design your app to teach others using the MIT AppInventor. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Health App [Day 1: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtM1X5I.gdoc)
- Computer with internet for food research

### project time:	
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 10 minutes
1. Play [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elaR3WhguVk)
	
	- Ask students what apps they like and why they are important to them. 
	- Ask students what apps they would like to be invented in the future.

2. Explain to students that apps can be a way to help people and give them new technology to carry around in their pockets. 
3. The app we will program will help students make healthier decisions about the foods they eat by providing a database of nutritional info about different foods.
4. Have students fill in the bold section of the following stats in their [Day 1: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtM1X5I.gdoc):
	- **17%** of children in America are overweight or obese
	- **38%** of Latino children in America are overweight or obese
	- Childhood obesity can lead to heart disease, **diabetes**, and high blood pressure

## Explore - 25 minutes
1. Instruct students to use the table from [Source 3](https://www.bcm.edu/research/centers/childrens-nutrition-research-center/consumer/archives/percentDV.htm) to fill in [Day 1: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtM1X5I.gdoc) for their specific age and gender group
2. Students spend the remainder of the explore time period to brainstorm 10 foods they eat regularly -- 5 they consider “healthy” and 5 they consider “unhealthy.” 

	- Using these foods, students conduct research to gather basic nutritional information in order to fill out in Day 1: Handout
    - Students should begin to see small connections between to see simple connections between the daily recommended values they need versus the nutritional values for their selected foods

## Explain - 10 minutes
1. Briefly discuss any connections students see between the daily recommended values for their age/gender and their favorite foods.
	- Students might respond with they likely eat more sugar than is recommended, if they eat x servings for x food, they will surpass the recommended calories, etc. 
2. Students fill out the following facts (bold portions) in the [Day 1: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtM1X5I.gdoc)
	- **Sugar**
    	- Not all sugars are equal! Natural sugars (like in fruit) are different from processed sugars (like in cookies)
		- How it can help: Gives your cells **energy** so your body can perform many functions
		- How too much can hurt: Scientists have connected poor memory, learning disorders, and **depression**.
		- Sugar consumption facts
			- Recommended: about **25-30 grams**
			- Average teen consumes: about **170 grams**!

	- **Fats**
    	- How it helps: Some “healthy” fats can help control **hunger** and keep you full longer.
		- How it hurts: Too much can lead to blocked arteries, meaning your heart has to pump harder to send blood through your body
		- Fat fact: Stores **energy** (2x better) than carbohydrates 
        
	- **Sodium**
    	- How it helps: Sodium helps our body regulate **water**, helps cells **talk** to each other, helps our muscles contract, and has many other roles!
		- How it hurts: Too much can lead to high blood pressure, **headaches**, and weight gain
