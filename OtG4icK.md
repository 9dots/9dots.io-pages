## Overview
The MIT AppInventor will be introduced and each student will create a project page under the instructor’s account. After getting familiar with the layout of the AppInventor and the basic functionality, students work with the instructor to design and build their first app!

## Setup
### materials:
- Health App Day 2: Handout
- Computer with internet for [MIT AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
- Android phone OR computer with [Android emulator downloaded](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
1. Show students the completed 'TalkToMe' App on Android device or emulator. Input different text into the _TextBox_ to show them what their final product should look like!
2. Ask students how this could be done on Scratch Programming

## Explain - 10 minutes
Students need to set up project pages for their health app. As an instructor, make a Google Account that can be accessible by all students and set a password that all students will recall. The following set of instructions are for students to create projects pages, using said Google account.

1. Go to [MIT AppInventor](www.appinventor.mit.edu)
2. Click on 'Create'
3. Sign in with the master Google Gmail account
4. 'Allow' the MIT AppInventor to use the Google account
5. Click on 'Projects' then select 'My Projects'
6. Have each student title their app using their first name followed by App (No spaces are allowed in the title)
	- Examples: MichaelsApp, BriannasApp, StevensApp, etc.
7. Select 'Start new project'

Next, have students become familiar with the basic functionality and layout of the program. Students may keep their computer open to compare their handout to the screen, however, be clear all students should be following along and filling in their handout.

1. Begin with the 'Designer' page. Read each component of the page and have students write in the blanks for each part of the screen on Handout: Day2

2. Continue to the 'Blocks' page. Read each component of the page and have students write in the blanks for each part of the screen on Handout: Day2

## (Guided) Explore - 15 minutes 
Students are ready to begin programming their first app. This Explore is meant to walk students through their first app, TalkToMe. Instructors should watch and become familiar with [video tutorials # 1 and # 2](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/beginner-videos.html)  in order to teach this lesson and the Elaborate extension challenge.

1. Ask students guiding questions regarding the page and command blocks they should be using. Push for accurate vocabulary from their handout. 
2. Begin with the designer page, then move to the blocks page.
3. The final code for each student should read as follows: 
	- 'Designer Page'
    ![](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtGBamq_md.jpg) 
    - 'Blocks Page'
    ![](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtGBiaw_md.jpg) 
- This first app is designed to say any text that is “ “ in the pink ‘Text’ block when the button is pressed. 
4. Add two quick challenges: 
	- Review that properties are used to further specify the components on the designer page. Have students change the text on 	_Button1_ from “Text for Button 1” to “Talk To Me!”
	- Back to the blocks page: Have students change their app to say “My name is ____________”

	- The green text box will tell your app to say anything that is typed into the _TextBox1_ when the app is running.
    
## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Provide students with 2 more extensions. 

1. Extension # 1: Explain to students that phones can also respond to various sensors, including when it moves. Using the accelerometer sensor from the palette, students should program their app to say “Stop shaking me” when it is shaken.

2. Extension # 2: Have students add a text box on the designer page. On the blocks page, students should then program their app to say whatever is typed into the text box.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Open up the emulator on each computer and students may check their code to see if it is properly functioning

## Standards
 
| Standard      | Description   | Connection  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| 3-5-ETS1-3 | Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify 
aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved | Explore, Elaborate |
| MS-ETS1-4 | Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process 
such that an optimal design can be achieved | Explore, Evaluate |
| CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP1 | Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them | Elaborate |
