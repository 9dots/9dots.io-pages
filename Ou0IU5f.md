## Overview
Today's lesson transitions from the 'Designer' page to the 'Blocks' page, where students begin programming one of the three screens. Students are given the challenge to program the app using the select blocks when given a description of the app functionality. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Health App [Day 5-6: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OtMM4NC.gdoc)
- Computer with internet for [MIT AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
- Android phone OR computer with [Android emulator downloaded](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Show students https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc#t=92 for 3-5 minutes.
2. Ask 2-3 students why they want to code and what they hope to achieve with this skill.

## Explore - 15 minutes

1. Instruct students to ‘Connect’ to the emulator to have in their view for the duration of the lesson. This will update real-time as the code is edited throughout the lesson, providing a visual for students.
2. Students need to rename several components to provide unique names for each component which will later prove to be useful in the block programming portion of the explore. 

	- Instruct students to rename a component, they must highlight the desired component within the ‘Components’ section of the web browser and then select ‘Rename’ at the bottom of the ‘Components’ section.
