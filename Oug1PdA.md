## Overview
In Today's lesson, students program Screen2 to store and retrieve food names and food facts to a database.

## Setup
### materials:
- Computer with internet for [MIT AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
- Android phone OR computer with [Android emulator downloaded](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Have an Android enabled device present with the completed app uploaded to the device. Show this to students for them to visualize the final design and functionality of the app they are to complete in the next two lessons.

## Explore (Part 1) - 10 minutes
'Screen2' stores and retrieves tags and values. There are two possible scenarios for data storage or retrieval: 

- A start value that is not blank. This is when a new tag (Food name) and value (Food fact) is added and stored to the database to later be viewed on the 'Info' screen. 
- A start value that has already been stored and is being edited. This is when a tag is being retrieved from the database.
