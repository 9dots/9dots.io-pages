title: Stop Motion Core Values
objective: 
  - Explain the importance of grit and develop a stop motion video using legos
id: "9dots-Our7Mx6"
blurb: "Students create a stop motion video using legos and the Photobooth software. Show a video of stop motion to show students the creativity that can go into an animation. Then, explain to students the need for grit to create a stop motion. Students demonstrate learning by creating a stop motion with as many pictures as possible."

## Setup

### Materials:

- Legos
- Computers with iMovie and Photobooth

### Stop Motion Examples:
- [Deadline Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWM0FNPZSs)
- [Summer Nights Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyjdt5Qso)
- [In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu0DuxFAT0)
- [Making of In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIH4MJAC2Tg&feature=youtu.be)
- [T-Shirt War Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWdSCt4jGE)
- [Wallace and Gromit Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDhmlMQT60)
- [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI)

### Preparation:
- Ensure all of the computers have iMovie installed
- Separate legos into separate boxes for the groups
- Set up projector to show stop motion examples

### Project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
Show students the [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI). 

- When it is finished discuss the attention to detail and patience that goes into making a stop motion video. For further examples, any of the other video from the stop motion examples section above can be shown.
    
## Explain - 10 minutes

1. Ask students a series of questions about animation
	1. _What is animation?_
		- To animate means to bring to life. An animation is the process of making a stationary object appear to move on it's own.
	2. _What is stop motion animation?_
    	- Stop motion animation is the process of taking pictures and playing them quickly to make it look like the objects are moving.
        
2. _What is grit?_
	- Grit is the ability to keep working hard and persevere in achieving goals.
    
3. _Why is grit important for making stop motion videos?_
	- Stop motion videos require a lot of attention to detail and focus over a long period of time to create.
    
4. Today, students compete to show the most grit by taking the most pictures for their stop motion and make their movie playback as smoothly as possible.

5. All students create the same scene: A snowman made out of play-doh that melts into a puddle.

6. Show an example of a bad stop motion with not enough pictures to demonstrate the importance of taking a lot of pictures with very small movements in beteween.

7. The instructions for creating the first stop motion are:
	1. Create the snowman out of play-doh
	2. Take a picture
	3. Smoosh the play-doh a small amount to make it melt
	4. Take a picture
	5. Repeats steps 3 and 4
    
```
It is important to not move the computer camera while taking pictures!
```

## Elaborate - 20 minutes

1. Students have 20 minutes to create the longest stop motion possible.

2. To view the stop motion that they have students can find the first picture in photobooth and hold the arrow key to the right.

## Evaluate - 5 minutes

1. Students watch the playback of their finished video and write down the number of pictures they managed to take.

2. Show the animation with the most images on the projector.
