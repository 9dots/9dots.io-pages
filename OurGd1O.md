### Materials:

- Legos
- Computers with iMovie and Photobooth

### Stop Motion Examples:
- [Deadline Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWM0FNPZSs)
- [Summer Nights Stop Motion Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyjdt5Qso)
- [In Your Arms Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu0DuxFAT0)

- [Wallace and Gromit Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDhmlMQT60)
- [Box Trolls Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfm4uPESCoI)

### Preparation:
- Ensure all of the computers have iMovie installed
- Separate legos into separate boxes for the groups
- Set up projector to show stop motion examples

## Engage

1. Watch the [T-Shirt War Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWdSCt4jGE)

2. Discuss with students, _"Would the video be as funny with only one person in it?"_

## Explain

1. Ask students:
	- _"What is collaboration?"_
		- Collaboration is the action of working with others to create something.
    - _"Why is collaboration important?"_
    	- Creating something with more than one person can lead to greater innovation and creativity. Having more people also means it is easier to find problems with what you are making.

2. Tell students that today they are working with a partner to create a stop motion that needs to have more than one moving character.

3. Each collaborator controls a character for the stop motion video.

## Elaborate
Students have 20 minutes to create a stop motion in collaboration with their partner.

## Evaluate

1. Students playback their video to see what they created.

2. The video that best demonstrates collaboration is shown on a projector for the whole class to watch.

3. Check for understanding by asking, _"What is collaboration?"_
