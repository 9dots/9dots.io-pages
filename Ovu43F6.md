## Overview
Students construct a Rube Goldberg machine that utilizes Little Bits inputs and outputs in to display an energy transfer using various devices with the end goal of popping a balloon. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Per Group:
	- 1 cardboard box
    - 2 12" foam tubing pieces
    - 1 marble
    - 10 dominos
    - 1 Little Bits input
    - 1 Little Bits output
    - 1 thumbtack
    - 1 balloon (inflated and tied)
- Per Class:
	- extra cardboard
    - tape
    - scissors
    - stopwatch
    
### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
1. Review a Rube Goldberg machine. 
	- A Rube Goldberg is a contraption or device that is purposely over-engineered to perform a very simple task in a very complicated 
2. Watch this [Rube Goldberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCYZrfrJ9QM) displaying various energy transfers. 

3. Ask students if they can identify any types of energy (Possible responses: potential when objects not moving, kinetic when objects moving, heat, fire, electricity, wind)

## Explain - 5 minutes
Introduce the different types of energy they may incorporate into their Rube Goldberg. 

1. Mechanical Energy: Energy that is possessed by an object due to its motion or position
	- Example: [Roller Coaster] (http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.rollercoaster/energy-in-a-roller-coaster-ride/)
    ![](http://uploads.9dots.io/Ovu6FiA_md.jpg) 
    - Little Bits: sound

2. Electrical Energy: Energy made available by the flow of electric charge through a conductor
	- Example: lightning, light switch, MaKey MaKey
	- Little Bits: light

3. Wind Energy: the energy extracted from wind using wind turbines to produce electrical power, windmills for mechanical power
	- Example: windmill
	- Little Bits: fan    

## Explore - 30 minutes
Challenge: Students are to construct a Rube Goldberg machine, using all of the materials listed that will successfully pop a balloon

- Students must keep their Rube Goldberg mechanical devices within the cardboard set (the car may be outside of the box)
- Students must use all materials provided
- The group that successfully pops the balloon with the longest running time wins (timing is stopped once car stops moving).

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test each groupâ€™s machine and measure whose balloon pops in the longest amount of time!
