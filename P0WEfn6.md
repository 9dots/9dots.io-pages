## Setup
### Materials 

- Scratch Day 1: Powerpoint
- Computer with internet access

### Project Time:

- 90 minutes

## Engage - 10 minutes

1. Show [BrainPop Programming Video](https://www.brainpop.com/math/dataanalysis/computerprogramming/)
2. Ask students why they think it is important to know computer programming.
3. Activity: Directions
	- Ask for a student volunteer.
	- Place a laptop (or any object) somewhere across the classroom
	- Tell the student they are to provide detailed instructions to walk to the laptop, pick it up, and return it to the teacher desk.
    	- Studets must provide step by step instructions
		- i.e. if student says move forward, simple move one step
		- The goal is for the class to learn to provide detailed instructions for the teacher, as if it was a computer program (instructions might include: turn right, turn left, move forward 3 steps, pick up computer with 2 hands, turn around, place computer on desk, etc.)

## Explore - 15 minutes

1. Show students [Scratch Day 1: Powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/P0WHRIH.pptx) 
2. Go to Go to [code.org](https://learn.code.org/hoc/1). Complete the first two challenges as a class.
3. Students spend the remaining time working through levels.

## Explain - 10 minutes
Repeat Block: repeats command inside the repeat block as many times as instructed. There may be more than 1 command in the repeat block. You may also repeat your code until a certain object is reached 

If Statement Block: a conditional statement that programs the sprite to perform a command if a certain criterion is met 
- Ex: _If_ it is raining outside, _then_ I will grab my umbrella.

If Else Block: a conditional statement that programs the sprite to perform a command if a certain criterion is met, or else they will perform a different command
- Ex: _If_ there is a path ahead, _then_ move forward, or else turn right

## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Students continue working on the puzzles and attempt to successfully complete all 20 levels.
