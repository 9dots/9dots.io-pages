  - List the three features of algorithms
  - Explain how to approach writing an algorithm
  - Generate solutions to problems using algorithmic thinking
blurb: "Using a series of hands on examples, students discover what an algorithm is and how to create their own algorithm to solve a problem. This first lesson is ‘unplugged’ so no computer is required to complete it."

## Setup

### Materials

### Preparations

### Project Time

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. What is an algorithm?
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k
	- An algorithm is a set of instructions that solve a problem step-by-step

2. After watching the video check for understanding by asking for another example of an algorithm that students do on a daily basis. Examples include:

	- Making food from a recipe is following an algorithm
	- Giving someone directions is creating an algorithm for them to follow
	- Counting the number of people in a room
    
## Explore - 10 minutes

1. As a class students develop an algorithm to draw a creature with a set number of attributes.
	- 3 eyes
	- 2 ears
	- 1 eye
	- Head
	- 4 Legs

2. After the group has written their algorithm, every student takes 1 minute to draw the creature based on the instructions the group has written.

3. Students compare their drawing with their neighbor.

4. Check for understanding by asking
	- Did everyone draw the same creature?
	- Why not?
	- What could you do to improve the algorithm so that everyone drew the same creature?
    
## Explain - 10 minutes

1. Why are algorithms important?
	- Algorithms are important for looking at a problem logically, and decomposing (breaking it down) into a set of simple problems to solve.

2. Here is an example of an algorithm for making a pot of tea:

	1. If the kettle does not contain water then fill the kettle
	2. Plug the kettle and turn it on.
	3. While the water is not boiling leave the kettle on.
	4. If the teapot is not empty then empty the teapot.
	5. Place tea leaves in the teapot.
	6. Pour water from the kettle into the teapot.

3. The three key features of algorithms are 

	1. Sequence
		- The steps of the algorithm happen in the specified order. Changing the order will make the algorithm not work.
	2. Selection
		- Selecting based on an option such as “If the kettle does not contain water then fill the kettle”
	3. Loop (or repetition)
		- Continue to rerun steps until a condition is met such as “While the water is not boiling leave the kettle on”

4. The goal of computer scientists is to make the most accurate (gets the correct answer) and efficient (uses the least amount of resources such as memory).
