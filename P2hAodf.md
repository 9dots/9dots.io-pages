## Setup

### Materials

- Computers with internet access
- [Programming 2 powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/P2hEWH9.pptx)

### Preparation

- Set up projector

### Project Time

- 45 minutes

## Engage -  5 minutes

- Watch the programming video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc.

## Explore - 10 minutes


1. Students go to www.getcoding.io to practice calling functions.

2. Scroll down to the 'Spaceman Sequencing Blockly' game.

3. Students have 10 minutes to try those levels.

## Explain - 15 minutes

1. What is programming?
	- Programming is giving a computer a specific set of instructions that it can follow to solve a problem.

2. How is programming related to the algorithms from the previous lesson?
	- Just like algorithms, programming is about giving specific instructions. In fact, programming is translating the same algorithms into a form that the computer can understand.

3. In this unit, students are learning how to code in two languages: Javascript and Blockly.

4. What does it look like?
	- The blocks from the Explore section are what programmers call functions.

5. Functions are pieces of code that are written to complete a certain task. For example, the move block is a function that moves the character one place forward.

6. To call a function in Javascript, you write the name of the function followed by parentheses. For example, writing `move()` calls the same move function as dragging the move block into the program.

7. Each function is a step of the algorithm to solve the problem.

8. Check for understanding 
Students write out the algorithm to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using the functions:

	1. getPeanutButter
	2. spreadPeanutButter
	3. getJelly
	4. spreadJelly
	5. stackBread
	6. cutSandwich

** To challenge students donâ€™t write the functions in the correct order. Make sure students add parentheses to the end of each function. **

## Elaborate - 15 minutes

Students take 5 minutes to do the same levels they did during the Explore section, but now they are calling the functions themselves (instead of using blocks).
