## Setup

### Materials

- [Microscopes Day 1: Handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/P3M6vGz.docx)
- Microscope with up to 100x magnification
- Prepared slides with size 10 Times New Roman font “e” under slide cover

### Lesson Time

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Visit http://htwins.net/scale2/

2. First explore zooming out, allow students to ask questions and observe the general scale.

3. Explain this unit focuses on microscopes, and then begin to zoom in. Allow students to observe and ask questions. Explain where the smallest size a microscope can see but there are many other smaller objects in our universe

## Pre-explore Explain - 10 minutes
Define and identify the components of a microscope, how to properly handle one, and the safety precautions that must take place when operating a universe.

1. Students may not touch microscopes until the end of the pre-explain portion of the lesson. 

2. Show students how to properly lift a microscope (not that students should be doing this). Lift the microscope with one hand firmly holding the arm and the other hand underneath the base. 
 
3. Provide students with the following diagram in the Microscope Day 1: Handout.

4. Quickly review each component (define later) with students.

5. Review the following tips on how to properly handle a microscope that are outlined in the handout:
	1. Always start with the light on the lowest power.
	2. Always rotate the coarse focus knob to move stage all the way away from the objects lens as possible before placing a slide on the stage.
	3. Begin with the lowest (4x) magnification objective lens and move up.
	4. Have the slide as high as possible without the slide touching the objective lens. Adjust the coarse focusing knob while looking through the eyepiece until the specimen comes into focus, always moving away from the lens very slowly until the specimen comes into focus.
	5. Then, adjust the fine focus controls until the specimen is in sharp focus.
	6. When using the 100x objective lens, do not rotate the coarse knob up while looking through the eyepiece. This may cause the glass slide to unknowingly crash into the lens, causing it to break.
	
## Explore - 10 minutes
This microscope activity demonstrates how to focus.

- Part 1 Procedure:  Letter “e”
	1.  Have each student group place the prepared “e” slide on the stage
	2.  Draw what is on the slide in FIGURE 1.
	3.  Students move the “e” so it is placed under the viewing area on the stage. Have students take turns focusing the slide
	4.  Place the slide on the stage and view in low power (4x).  Center the “e” in your field of view.  Draw what you see in FIGURE 2.
	5.  Move the slide to the left; what happens?  Move the slide to the right; what happens?  Up?  Down?
	6.  View the specimen in high power (10x).  Use the fine adjustment only to focus.  Draw what you see in FIGURE 3.

## Post-explore Explain - 10 minutes
Define the components of the microscope and the basic functionality.

1. Review what is observed in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.

2. Review what happened when the slide was moved to the left, right, up, and down.

3. Review the definitions of each component as written on Microscope Day 1: Handout.
	1. Eyepiece: part you look through; where you place your eye
	2. Arm: attaches eyepiece to the base
	3. Body tube: supports the eyepiece
	4. Coarse adjustment knob: moves the stage up and down to get the object into initial focus
	5. Fine adjustment knob: NEVER use under high power; used to make small adjustments to bring object into fine focus
	6. Nosepiece: rotating piece that changes objective lenses
	7. Objective lens: lens that magnify the object (4x, 10x, 40x, 100x)
	8. Stage: the place where the specimen is placed
	9. Diaphragm: allows different amount of light through the slide
	10. Light source: reflects light onto the stage to observe the specimen
	11. Base: supports the entire microscope

4. Review how to calculate magnification
	1. Multiply the magnification of the eyepiece by the magnification of the objective.
    
		Eyepiece = 10x
		Objective = 4x
			Total = 10 * 4 = 40x
            
		Eyepiece = 10x
		Objective = 40x
			Total = 10 * 40 = 400x

		Eyepiece = 10x
		Objective = 100x
			Total = 10 * 100 = 1000x

## Elaborate - 10 minutes
Have various other items available to students to continue practicing their adjustment and usage skills.

Ex: pencil lead, newspaper, construction paper, thread, needle, cloth, lego, foot  items (be careful to place on slide so as to not dirty the stage), electronics, etc.
