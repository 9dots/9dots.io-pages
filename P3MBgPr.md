objective: 
  - Observe and compare various prepared microscopes to identify differences between animals and plants.
blurb: "This activity it to continue improving microscope usage skills and focusing skills. Given 30 different prepared slides with various animals and plants, students have opportunity to attempt to identify the specimens before they are revealed."

- [Microscopes Day 2: Handout (slide guesses)](http://uploads.9dots.io/P3MDAtY.docx)
- Microscope with up to 100x magnification

- Cover the name of the specimen and number each specimen for students to identify

## LESSON TIME

- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes

1. Visit http://www.danoah.com/35-everyday-things-made-so-insanely-cool-under-a-microscope

2. Explain many of these items are seen using an electron microscope.

3. Electron microscope: The electron microscope is a type of microscope that uses a beam of electrons to create an image of the specimen. It is capable of much higher magnifications and has a greater resolving power than a light microscope, allowing it to see much smaller objects in finer detail (300,000x vs. 1000x).

## Explore - 30 minutes
Set up 5-7 prepared microscope slides at each microscope. 

1. Taking turns, students each look at the various slides and discuss what the specimen may be with their group.

2. Students write down their guesses and Microscopes Day 2: Handout.

3. Each group moves to the next microscope and set of slides after 6 minutes.

**For each specimen, students should start at the lowest power and the lowest objective lens. They may increase light power and objective lens power as they explore the slide (4x → 10x → 40x → 100x) **

## Explain - 10 minutes
With the class, review each specimen on the numbers slides using the [Microscope Day 2: Powerpoint](http://uploads.9dots.io/P3MDS3L.pptx).
