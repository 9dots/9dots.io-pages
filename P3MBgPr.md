LESSON TIME
45 minutes

ENGAGE - 5 minutes

Explain many of these items are seen using an electron microscope
Electron microscope: The electron microscope is a type of microscope that uses a beam of electrons to create an image of the specimen. It is capable of much higher magnifications and has a greater resolving power than a light microscope, allowing it to see much smaller objects in finer detail (300,000x vs. 1000x)

EXPLORE - 30 minutes
Set up 5-7 prepared microscope slides at each microscope. 
Taking turns, students each look at the various slides and discuss what the specimen may be with their group.
Students write down their guesses and Microscopes Day 2: Handout.
Each group moves to the next microscope and set of slides after 6 minutes
*For each specimen, students should start at the lowest power and the lowest objective lens. They may increase light power and objective lens power as they explore the slide (4x → 10x → 40x → 100x) 
EXPLAIN - 10 minutes
With the class, review each specimen on the numbers slides using the Microscope Day 2: Powerpoint.
